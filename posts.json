He ran through a load of issues that all screamed \"just run fkin ccleaner\" to me and I took his unit back to my desk. \n\nAfter going through and cleaning out BS installed programs used literally once and never again and cleaning out junk data, I found that a folder in his roaming was reading 12GB but was hidden. I log in with my creds and enable viewing hidden or protected files and I see that the hidden folder was from 2014. Basically it was just a bunch of pictures and looked to be a temp folder created by one of the old programs I removed.

I was not prepared for what followed and was totally shocked by the outcome. \n\nThe lady wanted to thank me for finding the pictures and the exec reached out to shake my hand thanking me profusely before pulling me into a hug in front of the entire IT department. I awkwardly hugged him back and he let me go embarrassed. My eyes are wide flabbergasted and totally unprepared for this, extremely, out of character moment from this guy. \n\nBarely able to hold back the tears, his wife tells me that the pictures I recovered were thought to be lost. In 2012 their 4 year old son had died of lukemia and the pictures I recovered were taken right before his diagnosis at 3 years of age. Because of a  house fire a few years ago they thought they lost every last photo of their son.

He threw in words about striving for excellence and the unexpected results of every day excellence. \n\nI had to turn off my skype for business as the attaboys kept coming in one after the other.

I've been trying to learn ASL it as a sort of side-hobby for a few months now. Pete signs \"yes\" and we continue the conversation in Sign. Turns out the issue is with Skype, which keeps crashing on his roughly 5-year old tablet, and he's been having difficulty video-calling his wife who is Deaf.\n\nShe lives in a different continent, she travelled there for a temporary work opportunity and would be there for two years. This being the mid-way point, it's now been 1 year since Pete's seen his wife. Skype is the only way they both know how to communicate efficiently long-distance, as neither are comfortable with email or other text-based services.\n\nAs I go through verifying that he knows his password and making sure there's a backup of his device, Pete and I are signing back and forth and his face was completely lit up. I felt so good to be able to, albeit slowly, speak with him in his language and give him the time he deserved, even if his reason for visiting us had little to do with our physical product.\n\nOnce everything was verified and backed up, I uninstalled Skype and reinstalled it, had Pete sign in, and use Skype's test call to ensure it wouldn't crash (as it would immediately upon call creation before). Test call went through fine. Sweet.\n\nI looked down to write a few extra notes and began to hear some coughs. I looked up and there was Pete, crying while waving to his wife through Skype. Pete called her and she picked up! He introduced me to her and told me that it'd been 3-weeks since they'd heard from each other. I stepped away to give him a moment alone.\n\nIt's moments like these that keep me going as a technician. Even though I barely touched Pete's tablet, \"fixing\" it made me feel like a hero. It's been a few days and I can still see his smile.\n\nJust thought I'd share, thanks for reading.\n\nObligatory: Wow, this exploded overnight! Thank you all for your kind words.

Technician for a large company, I have a team of 8 people under me and we support high ranking executives and their administrative assistants.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of our work, we have the ability to \"get things done\" that the standard help desk cannot, We can force upgrades that would otherwise be denied, get things expedited, skip the normal procedures and talk directly with the people who fix the issues. \n\n\nWhile we are executive support, there are still levels, when the CEO is in town, one of us is camped outside of where ever he might be in case there is any sort of issue. \n\nFor lower people, we make sure things get done as quick as possible, but it's not a drop everything situation.\n\nAs we prepped for the releases of the new iPhones, we braced for the flood of \"I NEED this\" that inevitably happens.  We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing. \n\nSo on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X's\n\nThe Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about \"I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc\" \n\nStill denied.\n\nOn Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.\n\nI send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.\n\nthe EA states \"I was using it and it fell into my water bottle\" \n\nSo we take the phone back to our area and I've called my manager over and we explain it, It's obvious what has happened,  We've toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen. \n\nWell as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.\n\n10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can't work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don't give her one \"EXECUTIVE\" will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her \"A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced\"\n\nQueue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of \"EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS\" and statements of \"I can't believe this is happening to me, how will I work?\" \n\nWednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask \"What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?\"\n\nThe reply: \"Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn't fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.\"\n\nWell ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.\n\nOn the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.\n\nShe picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs. \n\nSo we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it. \n\nTermination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.  \n\n7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.\n\n8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she's alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she's being framed.\n\nAs she's brought through the main foyer, I'm on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.\n\nBoth phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution. Company policy when there is a messy separation.\n\nMaybe I'll buy my team pizza for lunch today, seems like the right thing to do.\n\nTLDR; Executive Assistant breaks iPhones in her quest to get an iPhone X, gets unemployment instead.

We slot in orders immediately for the top of the pyramid guys, and then work our way down, replacing, or sometimes having to tell them that they have to wait because the device they have is too new to warrant replacing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on Monday, the EA of a lower end Exec put in a request to get both herself and the exec new 256 Gig iPhone X&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Exec was put on the approval list, with a wait, but the EA was denied.  She had just been issued an iPhone 7 a few months ago, and she began to raise hell about &amp;quot;I have to support him, so I need to have the exact same phone etc etc&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still denied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I get a ticket from the EA - iPhone will not turn on, require replacement with attached ticket for iPhone X request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I send one of my drones out to investigate and I immediately get a text saying I have to get out there, I get out there and the iPhone is wet, not just wet, but dripping wet, like just pulled out of a glass of water wet with a screen that could only be called heavily Cracked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the EA states &amp;quot;I was using it and it fell into my water bottle&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we take the phone back to our area and I&amp;#39;ve called my manager over and we explain it, It&amp;#39;s obvious what has happened,  We&amp;#39;ve toweled it off and when we turn it over, water drizzles out of the cracked screen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well as luck would have it, we have spares, so I pluck a nice 64 gig Rose Gold iPhone 6s that was returned when the previous owner departed the company, I call and have the sim reprovisioned, I re-assign the phone in Airwatch and I have the phone returned to the EA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later, said EA is at our door, ranting, screaming saying that she can&amp;#39;t work like this, she needs a new phone and if we don&amp;#39;t give her one &amp;quot;EXECUTIVE&amp;quot; will make us give her one.  I step in and tell her &amp;quot;A permanent replacement is just beginning the process, we have had to issue you this phone as a loaner so you can continue working until a permanent replacement is sourced&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Queue Wednesday, the approval process has come back denied for her replacement, the loaner phone is now her permanent phone.  This info is relayed to the EA, who is fuming, lots of &amp;quot;EXECUTIVE WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS&amp;quot; and statements of &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe this is happening to me, how will I work?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday afternoon, same EA, new ticket - iPhone broken, need replacement.  I head out myself to see the issue and the phone looks like it was dragged behind a semi truck for 100 miles, the screen is shattered, a big chunk missing out the top near the camera, big dents in the back.  I calmly ask &amp;quot;What happened? This phone was perfect this morning?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reply: &amp;quot;Well, since you gave me an old phone, my case didn&amp;#39;t fit and it slipped out of my hands and fell down the stairs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well ok, could you tell me when and what stairwell this happened? she does, and I take the mangled phone, I grab my manager and we head off to the security office, and we pull the tapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the video we see the EA walking up the stairwell (concrete stairs, metal hand rail, your typical big building non public stairwell) she reaches the top and proceeds to fling the phone, like one would skip a stone, down from the 6floor to the mid floor landing, where it lands, she steps on it and then kicks it down to the 5th floor, it bangs off the metal fire door and she picks it up, examines it and then tosses it down the stairs to towards the 4th floor, bouncing off a few steps before landing on the mid landing between 5 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She picks the device up, and pries a large section of something off the phone (We suspect this was the chunk missing by the camera) and then heads back up the stairs, running the phone against the cinder block wall as she climbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we grab a copy of the video, we head straight to HR, we sit with the personnel director, we show her the video, we show her the 2 damaged iPhones, we show her the tickets, I relay the abuse thrown to myself and my techs about how she demands an iPhone X and has taken to destroying company property to get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Termination follows, however the user has gone home for the day, her accounts are disabled, her security badge flagged.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7:30 am today, the EA attempts to get into the building and her badge does not work, so she has to walk to the security office, the security officer takes the badge, and walks her to HR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 am, the Security officer and two members of HR are escorting the EA out of the building, she&amp;#39;s alternating between yelling and crying, Demanding that EXECUTIVE be called and that she&amp;#39;s being framed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she&amp;#39;s brought through the main foyer, I&amp;#39;m on the 2nd floor balcony that overlooks the entrance, she looks up at me, curses me and is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both phones, her laptop and other equipment have been placed with the Legal team as a precaution.

The job pays well and for the most part the people I deal with are fairly nice to talk to.\n\nQuite often we'll get calls from seniors (especially in the morning) who have premise equipment issues such as \"snow on screen\" or \"no signal\" on their TV sets connected to our digital equipment. \n\nNow my heart does go out to some of these folk because up until recently (past few years) we would supply straight analog cable to many homes (coax direct from wall to TV with scrolling guide).  However most cities we service nowadays require our digital equipment to receive channels, and this has caused a lot of frustration with older people who don't know how to operate said equipment (ie. always having your TV set on \"video\" or \"hdmi\" to get picture).  So often times we get customers who are repeat offenders with long ticket histories of these types of issues.\n\nSo anyway, I get a call from an older gentleman who's quite bitter and mean right off the bat (doesn't like that I asked for his address / telephone number to verify the account, hates that he has to speak with a machine before reaching an agent, etc.).  I have some experience handling these types of customers, however this call was going to be a little different.\n\nI spent over 45 minutes with this guy (we'll call him Mr. Smith) trying to get his TV set connected to the digital box properly so he could receive a picture.  No luck.  He was getting clearly frustrated by the whole ordeal and started blaming me for not being able to do my job properly, how I was useless, etc. \n\nWhatever.\n\nLike I said, I've dealt with this before so I tried my best not to take it personally, but eventually I had to ask him if we could book a service tech to the home (a courtesy call) to get his TV working correctly.  Unfortunately, our booking calendar was showing an appointment 3 days out.   That's when he dropped this on me:\n\n\"Don't bother sending a goddamn technician, because I'll be dead by then.  I'm 94 and TV is the only thing I have left, are you really going to make me wait for a tech?\"\n\nI instantly felt bad.  I mean, I've heard every complaint in the book as to why people don't want to wait for a tech but this one kind of got to me.  I'm in my mid-20's so honestly I can't even imagine how it must feel to utter those words.\n\nSo I spoke with my supervisor, who said they'd see if we could get someone out earlier...but we couldn't promise anything.  So I let Mr. Smith know and he was predictably not very happy with my answer.  \n\nAt that point it almost sounded like he started to cry and went into how he has no family left, and no friends that come visit (this was after I asked if there was anyone in his building that might be able to help).  Man.  I felt terrible, so I took it upon myself to ask Mr. Smith if I could pay a visit (he lived in a small city over from where I was, not very far to drive).  \n\nHe was a little shocked I was willing to do this, but sounded thankful I was willing to come out and help him personally.\n\nSo I head over, get to the residence and meet him - within 30 seconds I had the cable running again (simple input change) and even brought him a simplified remote for his set top box to avoid this problem in the future.\n\nThat's when he started crying.  He goes into how he hasn't actually spoken or really interacted with anyone for years.  He gave me a hug and told me how thankful he was that I came out and helped him, and told me how sorry he was for being so mean earlier on.  I said it was no problem and I was happy to help, and that was it - I left.\n\n3 weeks later, my supervisor comes to my desk and asks me if I could come speak with her for a bit about an account for \"Mr. Smith\".  Turns out, he sent the cable company a letter outlining how thankful he was for helping him with his issue and how it really \"made an old man happy again for once in a very long time\".  The letter was framed and put on our front entrance to retail.\n\nI guess the moral of this story is no matter how nasty someone is to you over the phone, sometimes they're not always a terrible person and just going through a lot.  I still think about Mr. Smith occasionally when I get those nasty customers and it makes me feel a little better.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading just thought I'd share how this one call changed my outlook on life :)\n\n", "author_fullname": "t2_cr2xr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 30, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Don't bother sending a tech, I'll be dead by then\"", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_28qemm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14209, "total_awards_received": 35, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14209, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1450644585.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 2, "gid_2": 30}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1403371112.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my story starts on what was a normal day taking calls on the front line for a large cable company.

$Usr - Hi, I am still off sick but I am not.  \n&gt; $Me  - Oh, did you mean to call HR or is there an IT issue?  \n&gt; $Usr - It's an IT issue. I am back at work now but I am still sick.  \n&gt; $Me  - I don't understand the issue.  \n&gt; $Usr - I have tried to log into $HRsystem but it has me listed as off sick.  \n&gt; $Me  - Ah, I see, You need to add an end date to your sickness.  \n&gt; $Usr - But I am back now.  \n&gt; $Me  - That's ok, you need to fill in the date field with when you came back.  \n&gt; $Usr - I am back now.  \n&gt; $Me  - Ok, did you start back at work today?  \n&gt; $Usr - Yes, I am back now.  \n&gt; $Me  - Do you have the $HRsystem open in front of you?  \n&gt; $Usr - Yes.  \n&gt; $Me  - Can you see the field for 'Date returned to work'?  \n&gt; $Usr - Yes.  \n&gt; $Me  - Click the little calendar icon and select the date you returned.  \n&gt; $Usr - But I am back now.  \n\n*Are you? Are you really? I am pretty sure you've left your brain cell at home though*\n\n&gt; $Me  - So select $TodaysDate from the calendar that pops up.  \n&gt; $Usr - Why?  \n&gt; $Me  - So that the $HRsystem knows that you're back at work and not still off sick.  \n&gt; $Usr - But I am back now.  \n\n*Are you a rubbish chat bot sent to test me?*\n\n&gt; $Me  - You need to tell the HR system when you came back so it unlocks your profile.  \n&gt; $Usr - Can't it tell?  \n&gt; $Me  - How would it tell?  \n&gt; $Usr - Well I am in the building and logged into my computer, is that not enough?  \n\n*This is a test, has to be a test, am I getting secret shoppered???*\n\n&gt; $Me  - The systems aren't linked in that way. People come into work all the time when off on holiday or sick to drop things off/collect things. If the system logged that as a day in work then holiday and sick pay would be all messed up. We also have a number of remote users who are never in the office.  \n&gt; $Usr - So how do I sort this out?  \n\n*ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?*\n\n&gt; $Me  - Fill in the date field!!!!!\n\n*I need to get out of this call!*\n\n&gt; $Me  - Can I remote onto your system and help you sort it.  \n&gt; $Usr - Would you mind. It might be easier.  \n\n*Too F'in right it'll be easier*  \n\n&gt; $Me  - Ok, I am on and I'll just add today's date in here and we're all set.  \n&gt; $Usr - So I am back now?  \n&gt; $Me  - Yes, you're no-longer being shown as off sick.  \n&gt; $Usr - Can you reset my password while I've got you on?  \n\n*Please please please IT gods, don't do this to me*  \n\n&gt; $Me  - What's wrong with your password?  \n&gt; $Usr - Nothing, but I got the about to expire message when I logged in and I want to you to reset it for me.  \n&gt; $Me  - You can change your password yourself by clicking the change password link when you see that screen or wait for it to expire and you'll be forced to do it when you next log in.  \n&gt; $Usr - I don't want to change my password.  \n\n*You did this to me...*\n\n&gt; $Me  - You have to change your password every 60 days.  \n&gt; $Usr - Can't you just give me another 60 days?  \n&gt; $Me  - The policy of changing it is for security.  \n&gt; $Usr - My password is very secure.  \n\n*Ok $Usr, I want to play a game...*\n\n&gt; $Me  - Ok, what's your current password?  \n&gt; $Usr - It's $actuallyquitesecurepassword.  \n&gt; $Me  - Ok, now that you have told me your password it is no longer secure and I must insist you change it immediately.  \n&gt; $Usr - You work in IT you knew my password anyway!  \n&gt; $Me  - No, all passwords are secure. I can reset passwords but I can not look at them. As I am still connected to you I will help you change it now.  \n\nProceed to open the password change menu for $User. $User fills in the fields and gets an error saying that new password is a previously used password and thus can't be allowed.\n  \n&gt; $Usr - It won't let me change it.  \n&gt; $Me  - You didn't change it, you just typed it in again?  \n&gt; $Usr - I don't want to change my password!  \n&gt; $Me  - You have too. It is company policy.  \n&gt; $Usr - Passwords are hard to remember.  \n&gt; $Me  - Just pick a couple of random words and then add a number and a symbol.  \n&gt; $Usr - what do you mean?  \n&gt; $Me  - Like DeskMugPhonePencil1! Just pick a few things you can see from your desk and ta da! Easy to remember.\n\n*$Usr's new password is 100% going to be DeskMugPhonePencil1!*  \n\n&gt; $Usr - Ok that's done then.  \n&gt; $Me  - Ok enter the details on screen then.\n\n**New password accepted**  \n*Thank F@ck!*  \n\n&gt; $Me  - That's all sorted for you then.  \n&gt; $Usr - Great.  \n&gt; $Me  - I'll disconnect the remote connection.  \n\n*Freedom*  \n\n&gt; $Usr - I just thought.  \n\n*Oh balls*  \n\n&gt; $Usr - I have been back since last Thursday so will that all be right?  \n&gt; $Me  - You watched me fill in your return date as today because you said it was today.  \n&gt; $Usr - I am back today but I came back last week.  \n&gt; $Me  - Go in $HRsystem and change the return date to last Thursday.  \n&gt; $Usr - How do I do that?  \n\n*Screw you IT gods!!!*\n\n&gt; $Me  - I'll remote back in and sort it.  \n  \n&gt;:'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( :'(\n", "author_fullname": "t2_y5b0j", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 2, "clicked": false, "title": "Hi, I am still off sick but I am not.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "all long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_51eixz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14048, "total_awards_received": 2, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long r/ALL", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14048, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1473159158.0, "author_flair_css_class": "tftsflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 2}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1473156987.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Me  - Hello, IT.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Usr - Hi, I am still off sick but I am not.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me  - Oh, did you mean to call HR or is there an IT issue?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Usr - It&amp;#39;s an IT issue.

After a couple of minutes he's not taking this is not something we did, but his mistake as a answer, so I get an idea, I tell him I'm going to go speak to my manager.

My phone is having trouble recieveing emails, however, but I can receive the file by facebook message.\n\n&gt; Steve\n\nJack had been out of the office about twenty minutes when Boss forwarded this to me. I called him at his desk. \"Hey Boss. I just got the email you forwarded me. You need me to send file XYZ for you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Can you...can you send people files on facebook?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can. But I'll have to use the computer Jack's been using, though. It's the only one that can access facebook.\"\n\n\"Right, right. I'll meet you in my wife's office.\"\n\nI hung up the phone and launched a single .bat file on my desktop. it ran its commands and then deleted itself as I walked away.\n\n*\n\nI got to Boss' Wife's office a few minutes later. I smiled to her and Boss before crossing to the computer. \"Give me a second to bring up facebook and then--\" I turned the laptop around to face us and Boss's wife reached over, moving the mouse. The screen flared to life.\n\nBoss stared. Boss' Wife gasped. A soft moan, followed by the neigh of a horse, emanated from the laptop. She frantically closed the video window...revealing a second window underneath it; a Bing search for \"*best places to buy weed near me*\". She closed that one, too...revealing Buzzfeed's \"*10 signs you're over your job*\".\n\nAs she slammed the laptop shut, Boss shook his head, red and shaking with anger. \"How...How was that--I mean, I thought--WHO WAS USING THIS COMPUTER?\" he roared.\n\nBoss's wife shook her head. \"Jack was using it about a half-hour ago...\" As as if on cue, Jack appeared in the doorway with the leftovers from lunch in a carryout bag in his hand.\n\nBoss's back was to him. \"THAT KIND OF THING SHOULD BE BLOCKED!\" He yelled at me, pointing to the laptop.\n\nI nodded. \"I agree. Jack said he needed to use the unrestricted computer for some important projects. That's why he asked you to retrieve the key to my desk last week, right?\" I pointed to the door with my chin and Boss saw Jack. \n\nJack blinked at Boss. He looked at me. He looked at the computer. Then back to me. I could see it dawned on him what was going on. \"Y-you did something to my computer, didn't you?!\" He demanded.\n\nOf course I had. I had copied a hidden batch file onto Jack's desktop from a USB drive when I \"fixed\" his computer the other day. A file that would send me his browsing history without remoting into his desktop or alerting him. Then, all it would need would be a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. The file would then delete itself after launching three web pages as soon as the mouse moved...three of the most incriminating web pages Jack had ever visited on the computer. All it needed was a remote command, which I'd set off from my own computer. Granted, it wasn't entirely untraceable, but the only person who'd know what to look for was in this room, looking with as angry a face I could muster at the awful end user who had become the bane of my existence.\n\nBoss's wife chimed in. She was, at least, slightly more computer-savvy than her husband. \"No. Clickity didn't do anything. He just exited the...you know. The screensaver. Whatever was there must have been what you were...um...*working on* when you rushed out of the office for lunch.\" she glared at Jack and then addressed Boss. \"He must have forgotten to close out the evidence of his *blatant* misuse of company property.\" \n\nI shook my head solemnly. \"And I trusted you with this unrestricted computer, too, Jack. I even gave you your own email address for the company because I thought you'd be an asset. Clearly...clearly I was wrong.\" I tried my best to sound hurt.\n\nBoss's Wife nonchalantly picked up the laptop and handed it to me. \"Jack, I am rather upset that you'd do something like this. I hired you as a favor to your mother. And you can be certain she'll hear about this. Now go home.\"\n\nJack stood there, shaking. He probably had an idea of what I had done, but he'd have no way to prove it. \"But...He...I...\" He pointed at me wordlessly.\n\n\"GET OUT!\" Boss yelled.\n\nJack burst into tears and ran from the room.\n\n*\n\nNow, as I write this, it's been four weeks since Jack was terminated. I \"patched\" the \"security hole\" from Spotify and the interns are listening to music again. I didn't give the spare desk key back to the office manager.  As for Jack...I saw him the other day when he stopped by with his mother. He came and knocked on my door.\n\n\"Um...Clickity?\"\n\nI looked up and narrowed my eyes. \"What.\"\n\n\"I just...I wanted to say I'm sorry for...for saying that stuff and...acting like I did...\"\n\nI blinked.\n\n\"...and...um...now that I've apologized, I was hoping you could tell my mom that I didn't really look up any of that stuff. You...You know you're the one who did it. Not me. I mean...\" he took a breath. \"I mean, I've learned my lesson...so...\"\n\n*Seriously?*\n\n\"Come on, Clickity. She's made me get another job...and she cut my allowance...COME ON!\" He looked at me pleadingly. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Actually, not even almost.\n\nI shook my head and went back to typing. Jack continued standing there, and after a few long moments I looked at him.\n\n\"You can go now.\"\n\nAnd then he was gone.\n\n**Edit:** Clarity on my evil plan\n\n**Edit 2**: Wow! 3 gildings on one post.

Since you are an independent contractor the company treats you differently than an employee. Also, just due to the nature of contract work, your engagement is usually short term. This makes you a temporary fixture and sometimes are just treated as the \"fly on the wall\" like you do not exist. And this can lead to some interesting observations including seeing train wrecks in progress.\n\nThis is one of those tales. Not so much about the nuts and bolts of tech support, but more about the people and some good old fashion just desserts.\n\n**Background...**\n\nAs a consultant, you are always going to be the \"IT Guy\" whether you like it or not. No matter how you market your services every single company is going to assume you can do anything with a computer. And, when business is slow, this is not necessarily a bad thing if you just need work.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I found myself in a situation. I got an inquiry through my website asking about assistance deploying some workstations and other mundane tasks. Usually I would pass on this kind of work, but it was winter and the other client work was dry that month. A guy still has to pay the bills so I followed up and within a day the scope of work was signed.\n\nEasy stuff. The company had its own IT department, but just needed some extra hands. I was going to be one of three outside contractors that would deploy some workstations, do some server admin work, and set up some other equipment for a new department. The money wasn't the best, but it was time I had free and it was all swing shift work (meaning no traffic and I get to sleep in). Not bad.\n\n**The First Day**\n\nI report as requested about 3PM and talk to our contact. He was a Senior Engineer in charge of part of the IT department there. Saying he really doesn't have time to do anything more than a quick introduction as they are slammed with work, he shows us the ropes and leaves us to it. Between three of us we break down our specialities and parse out the work. Everyone knows this is a cake walk of a job and wants to just get it done fast as the pay was flat rate.\n\nI take the server work and see my contact who the System Administrator. Figuring he was probably gone for the day as it was mid-evening I was just going to leave him a note asking him to call me, but to my surprise he is at his desk. In fact, just about everyone in the IT department are milling around. Didn't think much of it at the time, just that it was one busy department and the guys must be pulling double shifts. He shows me the systems and I get to work. Around midnight we are wrapping up for the night and the three of us break down what we have left with the Senior Engineer who is still on site. The plan is to wait until Friday night to deploy the workstations and get everything in place. The Senior Engineer says most of his team will probably be there all weekend anyhow so doesn't matter to him.\n\nI left thinking, \"man that is a busy place...those guys must really be pulling down the overtime...I wonder what is going on they have so much work...\" as I walked out the door that night.\n\nSoon enough I would find out the deal.\n\n**Friday Night**\n\nHead to the work site a little early on Friday figuring if we all pull a long night we should be able to wrap it up and all get our weekend back. Things are going great and we are ahead of schedule so the Senior Engineer offers to take us out a local diner while we wait for the office to close up so we can deploy workstations without tripping over people.\n\nAt the diner:\n\nSenior Engineer (SE): \"I want to thank you guys for all your hard work. We are all overworked and when we got approval to contract out this job everyone was excited.\"\n\nIT Guy (me): \"Hey glad to be of service. Looks like you guys are crazy busy. Is everyone pulling doubles and doing weekends to handle your ticket load?\"\n\nSE: \"Oh we are understaffed so we all have to pull extra hours...\"\n\nMe: \"That sucks, but must be some great overtime...\"\n\nSE: \"Overtime....not really...we are all salaried...some loophole or something...we just put in the time because we all need the job right now...\"\n\nThe conversation trailed off from there, but it left me thinking, \"in this state most IT workers are eligible for overtime as a matter of law...there is no loophole like that...something isn't right...\"\n\n**Back at the work site...**\n\nI'm in the network closet with the Systems Administrator hooking up some ports and finishing the server work. He is a friendly guy so we start chatting.\n\nMe: \"I was talking to your buddy and it seems like you guys work insane hours here...\" (I ask trying to fish for a little information)\n\nSystems Admin (SA): \"Oh yeah, it has been like this for a year. 60 hours is a light week these days. It is bullshit.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah the other guy said you don't get overtime...\"\n\nSA: Laughs. \"That is what the boss tell us. Let me show you something.\"\n\nHe pulls up an email exchange he had with his manager. It is dated about 10 months ago and makes the very point I thought that the entire department should be getting overtime and the law requires it. His boss' response in bold and caps was \"**IT IS COMPANY POLICY TO NOT PAY ANY OVERTIME. WORKING MORE THAN 40 HOURS IS PART OF THE JOB. DEAL WITH IT OR FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO WORK.\"** Then the SA smirks and shows me his response to the boss, \"**Sure. OK. Whatever**\" (his emphasis). And that was the end of the exchange.\n\nMe: \"Look I'm not a lawyer, but you might want to call up the labor department...I'm pretty sure it is illegal for you to not be getting overtime...\"\n\nThen to my surprise, the SA pulls up another email from his personal account. \"Oh it is blatantly illegal. I asked a lawyer and this was his response.\" (He showed me a memo explaining the law and that most likely a lawsuit would be successful. This was dated about nine months ago.)\n\nMe: (confused) \"So you guys know you should be getting overtime but not getting paid and everyone is OK with that...?\"\n\nSA: \"We all make sure to log all of our hours and document the time.\"\n\nMe: (still confused) \"But you still aren't getting actually paid overtime?\"\n\nSA: \"No but we will. Here is the kicker. According to the lawyer the labor department will look back at the hours we put in for the last 12 months and award us retroactive overtime. So all of us just log our time and keep records then in about a month we are going to file a claim all together. The company is going to be on the hook for all that overtime and they won't be allowed to fire any of us for reporting them either.\"\n\n(Then the coup de grace...)\n\n**SA: \"We all figured when this whole thing started if we pressed the point back then they would just figure out a way to screw us. So we just all decided to stay quiet, put in the time they tell us to work, and we will get our 'bonus' check when it is all said and done if this stuff is all back dated.\"**\n\nDamn. That is some cold stone strategizing.\n\nMe: \"How many hours do you think you guys have piled up?\"\n\nSA: \"Hard to tell. Everyone keeps their own paper logs to keep it quiet. We also don't talk about it too much so nothing gets out but last time we met outside of work it was a boat load of time. I figure, for myself, they will owe me about 13-14 months of salary in overtime and when it is all said and done, add up damages, penalties, interest, it will probably total almost two years of pay.\"\n\nMe; \"Holy.....\"\n\nSA: \"So if the guys won't talk about it and seem eager to work all these long hours, now you know why.\"\n\nWe finished up the job that night. I exchanged contact information with a few guys and said if they had any other contract work to think about giving me a call. That was it, until...\n\n**Three Months Later...**\n\nI am at another job and see an email come in from the Systems Administrator, subject line \"Overtime Claim\":\n\n\"Hey IT Guy - Hope you are doing well. We all ended up filing a big overtime claim with the state and the company fired us for supposedly falsifying our timesheets. The lawyer is sorting it all out, but anyway I wanted to know if I could give your name to an investigator who is looking for witnesses to verify some of the extra hours we worked....(some details followed)\"\n\nI agreed to talk to the investigator and got a call about a week later. He asked me some routine questions about times and dates and wanted me to email him over some proof I did the job. Then he started going into the details of the case.\n\n\"We got this company for probably a million in overtime and damages between all the guys in the department plus the firing is probably illegal so that is going to be another few hundred thousand on top of it. The insurance company wants to settle and once we wrap up the due diligence work I think these guys are all going to make out rather nicely.\"\n\nI didn't hear anything for awhile, until another email came in from the Systems Administrator, subject line \"RE: Overtime Claim\":\n\n\"Just wanted to let you know we settled this whole thing. Company caved pretty quick once it was clear we kept honest logs of our time and the local management violated parent company regulations for the sake of making their site budget look better. Can't go into details, but we all got sizable checks, enough to pay off some loans, and go back to school. I'll have to find a new job but after I get my grad degree that shouldn't be an issue. Appreciate you talking to the investigators. Thanks IT Guy.\"\n\n**TLDR...**\n\nCompany tried to tell its employees they were not overtime eligible, despite being legally required to pay it, and worked them to the bone. IT department came up with a scheme to bank on that ignorance. Plan worked and the company was out probably several million dollars because of inept management.", "author_fullname": "t2_b0wilq5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Manager: \"Company Policy Is We Do NOT Pay For Overtime\", Tech: \"Sure, OK, Whatever\"", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "epic", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_krj7kt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12886, "total_awards_received": 53, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Epic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12886, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1609919994.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 12, "gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1609919027.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes as a consultant you get to see how an office functions from an outsider perspective.

So we just all decided to stay quiet, put in the time they tell us to work, and we will get our &amp;#39;bonus&amp;#39; check when it is all said and done if this stuff is all back dated.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Damn. That is some cold stone strategizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;How many hours do you think you guys have piled up?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SA: &amp;quot;Hard to tell. Everyone keeps their own paper logs to keep it quiet. We also don&amp;#39;t talk about it too much so nothing gets out but last time we met outside of work it was a boat load of time. I figure, for myself, they will owe me about 13-14 months of salary in overtime and when it is all said and done, add up damages, penalties, interest, it will probably total almost two years of pay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me; &amp;quot;Holy.....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SA: &amp;quot;So if the guys won&amp;#39;t talk about it and seem eager to work all these long hours, now you know why.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finished up the job that night. I exchanged contact information with a few guys and said if they had any other contract work to think about giving me a call. That was it, until...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Months Later...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am at another job and see an email come in from the Systems Administrator, subject line &amp;quot;Overtime Claim&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey IT Guy - Hope you are doing well. We all ended up filing a big overtime claim with the state and the company fired us for supposedly falsifying our timesheets. The lawyer is sorting it all out, but anyway I wanted to know if I could give your name to an investigator who is looking for witnesses to verify some of the extra hours we worked....(some details followed)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agreed to talk to the investigator and got a call about a week later. He asked me some routine questions about times and dates and wanted me to email him over some proof I did the job. Then he started going into the details of the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We got this company for probably a million in overtime and damages between all the guys in the department plus the firing is probably illegal so that is going to be another few hundred thousand on top of it. The insurance company wants to settle and once we wrap up the due diligence work I think these guys are all going to make out rather nicely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t hear anything for awhile, until another email came in from the Systems Administrator, subject line &amp;quot;RE: Overtime Claim&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just wanted to let you know we settled this whole thing. Company caved pretty quick once it was clear we kept honest logs of our time and the local management violated parent company regulations for the sake of making their site budget look better. Can&amp;#39;t go into details, but we all got sizable checks, enough to pay off some loans, and go back to school. I&amp;#39;ll have to find a new job but after I get my grad degree that shouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue. Appreciate you talking to the investigators. Thanks IT Guy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Company tried to tell its employees they were not overtime eligible, despite being legally required to pay it, and worked them to the bone. IT department came up with a scheme to bank on that ignorance. Plan worked and the company was out probably several million dollars because of inept management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc":

This one is the followup; set a year later, and is the story of how I finally ended up quitting that job. \n\nCast of characters: \n\n* Me! I was a lead sysadmin at a very large telco, responsible for the email system at the corporate HQ. I was a contractor there, which will become relevant to the story later. \n \n* Jim (J in my last story)- an IT architect at a large telco. Jim was my primary customer contact until he flew off the handle and tried to fire me under circumstances that were dubious at best.  Jim was a pretty smart technical guy who was also a bull in a china shop who shouldn't have been allowed to work around other people. \n \n* Lynne (not in the previous story) - Lynne is the IT architect who I was assigned to work with after Jim screwed the pooch in my previous story. She was awesome, for reasons that will become clear soon. She reported to Jim, and utterly loathed him. \n \n* Marie (M in the previous story)- Jim's boss, the IT department manager. She unfucked everything after Jim fired me.     \n\nIn early 2000, I got a phone call at home from an IT recruiter. This wasn't uncommon at all - I had at one point or another interacted with half the sleazy recruitment agencies in my city.   This call was a little bit different.  It was from an in house recruiter for a tech company, a company that was one of the shining stars of tech where I lived, with a reputation for not only having solid technology in their market, but also being a great place to work. They were an honest-to-goodness \"unicorn\" (back before anyone called them that.)  The conversation went something like this: \n\nRecruiter: Hi Blempglorf, this is Recruiter with CoolTechCompany, how are you today?  \nMe: Doing well, thanks, what can I do for you?\nRecruiter: Blempglorf, I'm calling because Lynne gave me a copy of your resume, and suggested that I reach out to you about a position we have open.  \n\nA bog standard HR introductory call followed, where I found out that they were looking for a lead Windows sysadmin for their internal IT department. \n\nNow this confused the shit out of me, because Lynne was my lead, albeit through a dotted line.  Let that sink in: my boss sent my resume to a recruiter without my knowledge or permission.  Obviously, this was something that warranted further investigation. \n\nSo, I called Lynne. Apparently, she had just interviewed at CoolTechCompany, and didn't get the job.  On the \"thanks but no thanks\" call from HR, she told the recruiter something to the effect of \"Well, that's too bad, but I know someone else you need to talk to.  Blempglorf is better at this stuff than me, and I think he'd love working at CoolTechCompany.\" And then she sent over my resume, which she had from when she referred me for an internal hire job in another division of the telco we both worked at. When I asked her why she did that she just said: \"You have to trust me on this one. I can't say more.\" \n\nSo I had a phone interview with the hiring manager at CoolTechCompany. And he and I meshed well, and he decided to bring me in for the full gauntlet interview with the rest of the sysadmin team there. \n\nAround this time, I got a meeting request from Jim, who I hadn't really interacted with a lot since the time he tried (and failed) to shitcan me.  At the meeting, Jim informed me that Telco had decided to insource all the contract sysadmins, and bring them on as direct Telco employees.  He had an offer letter waiting for me at the meeting. I opened the offer letter, only to discover that it was a 20% pay cut from what I was earning as a contractor, to do the same job.  There was a slight bump in terms of benefits value (from what I recall the 401k match was superior) but at first glance, it was obvious that this was a pay hit no matter how you added it up.  Jim also informed me that this wasn't optional, that the insourcing was going to happen whether I liked it or not, and that this was a \"take it or leave it\" offer. Not only would this be a pay cut, but I would also be reporting directly to Jim, as would all the other newly-insourced sysadmins on the team.  Either one of those would be dealbreakers, but I kept my mouth shut, knowing his history. \n\nI caught up with Lynne a few minutes later. She took one look at my face and knew what had just happened. \"This is why I told you to trust me.\" she said, before I even said a word. \n\nI could have kissed her. \n\nSo, a couple of weeks later I went in for the full interview at CoolTechCompany, which resulted in an offer that would have been a no brainer to accept even if I hadn't just had my pay cut. I received that offer just before the planned effective date of the insourcing (and pay hit.)\n\nThe next day, I walked in to Lynne's cube and let her know that I'd gotten the job. She got this look of utter delight on her face, and said to me: \"You HAVE to let me be there when you tell Jim.\"  So, we walked over to his office together, and told him.  He looked absolutely floored, and as usually did when he didn't get his way, immediately went into argument mode. \n\n\"All the other sysadmins took the job.\" (True, but two others quit within the first two months because they didn't have the headstart on their job search that I did)\n\"You're making a big mistake\"  (And why would that be?)\n\"Do you think that little company is going to last?\"  (They did.)\n\nThe problem was that because of the planned insourcing, there was no mechanism to continue to pay me past the end of that week, as Telco's contract with the outsourcer was expiring. Enter Marie. Marie was Jim's boss, who I had a great relationship with. Now, I felt genuinely bad about this, because IT operations at corporate HQ was her responsibility, and this left her with not only no email server support, but only a day to figure out how to ensure continuity. (My backup had quit for unrelated reasons a month before.) I was perfectly willing to give 2 weeks notice per custom, mind you - they just didn't have a straightforward way to pay me for it. \n\nSo, Marie called me into her office, after Jim had left for the day. I told her that I was already in the interview process at the time Jim gave me the offer (This was true, although I left out the whole part about Lynne.), and the fact that it was such a big pay cut made it a no-brainer to continue the process. Marie had an utterly stunned look on her face, and she said to me: \"Pay cut?  You all were supposed to be kept at parity.\"  \n\nWhat I found out later (through my mole Lynne) was that Jim neglected to relay that instruction to company HR when they were preparing the offer letters.  They prepared the offers at what HR deemed to be market rate, which in this case was a substantial pay hit. I never found out if he did that on purpose, but given that he'd complained in the past that he thought we were overpaid for what we did, I'd be willing to hazard a guess that he did.  \n\nAnyway, even though Marie upped the offer to match my current pay rate (so much for take it or leave it) and promised that I'd be reporting to her given my past history with Jim, I still declined as my new job had a lot more long term opportunity.  I ended up taking the job at the telco, just long enough to work out my notice period. HR was *VERY* confused at my exit interview when they noticed that I'd been with the company for only 9 working days. \n\nIncidentally, I ended up staying at CoolTechCompany for over 8 years. It was the best career move I ever made. My only regret about it was that I was never able to get Lynne a job there.  On the other hand, Marie stepped in and took away all of Jim's supervisory responsibility over the sysadmins, sticking him in a strict technical role.  He lasted a few months after that and bailed out to a much smaller company.

Jim was a pretty smart technical guy who was also a bull in a china shop who shouldn&amp;#39;t have been allowed to work around other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynne (not in the previous story) - Lynne is the IT architect who I was assigned to work with after Jim screwed the pooch in my previous story. She was awesome, for reasons that will become clear soon. She reported to Jim, and utterly loathed him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie (M in the previous story)- Jim&amp;#39;s boss, the IT department manager. She unfucked everything after Jim fired me.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In early 2000, I got a phone call at home from an IT recruiter. This wasn&amp;#39;t uncommon at all - I had at one point or another interacted with half the sleazy recruitment agencies in my city.   This call was a little bit different.  It was from an in house recruiter for a tech company, a company that was one of the shining stars of tech where I lived, with a reputation for not only having solid technology in their market, but also being a great place to work. They were an honest-to-goodness &amp;quot;unicorn&amp;quot; (back before anyone called them that.)  The conversation went something like this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recruiter: Hi Blempglorf, this is Recruiter with CoolTechCompany, how are you today?&lt;br/&gt;\nMe: Doing well, thanks, what can I do for you?\nRecruiter: Blempglorf, I&amp;#39;m calling because Lynne gave me a copy of your resume, and suggested that I reach out to you about a position we have open.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bog standard HR introductory call followed, where I found out that they were looking for a lead Windows sysadmin for their internal IT department. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this confused the shit out of me, because Lynne was my lead, albeit through a dotted line.  Let that sink in: my boss sent my resume to a recruiter without my knowledge or permission.  Obviously, this was something that warranted further investigation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I called Lynne. Apparently, she had just interviewed at CoolTechCompany, and didn&amp;#39;t get the job.  On the &amp;quot;thanks but no thanks&amp;quot; call from HR, she told the recruiter something to the effect of &amp;quot;Well, that&amp;#39;s too bad, but I know someone else you need to talk to.  Blempglorf is better at this stuff than me, and I think he&amp;#39;d love working at CoolTechCompany.&amp;quot; And then she sent over my resume, which she had from when she referred me for an internal hire job in another division of the telco we both worked at. When I asked her why she did that she just said: &amp;quot;You have to trust me on this one. I can&amp;#39;t say more.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I had a phone interview with the hiring manager at CoolTechCompany. And he and I meshed well, and he decided to bring me in for the full gauntlet interview with the rest of the sysadmin team there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around this time, I got a meeting request from Jim, who I hadn&amp;#39;t really interacted with a lot since the time he tried (and failed) to shitcan me.  At the meeting, Jim informed me that Telco had decided to insource all the contract sysadmins, and bring them on as direct Telco employees.  He had an offer letter waiting for me at the meeting. I opened the offer letter, only to discover that it was a 20% pay cut from what I was earning as a contractor, to do the same job.  There was a slight bump in terms of benefits value (from what I recall the 401k match was superior) but at first glance, it was obvious that this was a pay hit no matter how you added it up.  Jim also informed me that this wasn&amp;#39;t optional, that the insourcing was going to happen whether I liked it or not, and that this was a &amp;quot;take it or leave it&amp;quot; offer. Not only would this be a pay cut, but I would also be reporting directly to Jim, as would all the other newly-insourced sysadmins on the team.  Either one of those would be dealbreakers, but I kept my mouth shut, knowing his history. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Lynne a few minutes later. She took one look at my face and knew what had just happened. &amp;quot;This is why I told you to trust me.&amp;quot; she said, before I even said a word. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could have kissed her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a couple of weeks later I went in for the full interview at CoolTechCompany, which resulted in an offer that would have been a no brainer to accept even if I hadn&amp;#39;t just had my pay cut. I received that offer just before the planned effective date of the insourcing (and pay hit.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I walked in to Lynne&amp;#39;s cube and let her know that I&amp;#39;d gotten the job. She got this look of utter delight on her face, and said to me: &amp;quot;You HAVE to let me be there when you tell Jim.&amp;quot;  So, we walked over to his office together, and told him.  He looked absolutely floored, and as usually did when he didn&amp;#39;t get his way, immediately went into argument mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All the other sysadmins took the job.&amp;quot; (True, but two others quit within the first two months because they didn&amp;#39;t have the headstart on their job search that I did)\n&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re making a big mistake&amp;quot;  (And why would that be?)\n&amp;quot;Do you think that little company is going to last?&amp;quot;  (They did.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was that because of the planned insourcing, there was no mechanism to continue to pay me past the end of that week, as Telco&amp;#39;s contract with the outsourcer was expiring. Enter Marie. Marie was Jim&amp;#39;s boss, who I had a great relationship with. Now, I felt genuinely bad about this, because IT operations at corporate HQ was her responsibility, and this left her with not only no email server support, but only a day to figure out how to ensure continuity. (My backup had quit for unrelated reasons a month before.) I was perfectly willing to give 2 weeks notice per custom, mind you - they just didn&amp;#39;t have a straightforward way to pay me for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Marie called me into her office, after Jim had left for the day. I told her that I was already in the interview process at the time Jim gave me the offer (This was true, although I left out the whole part about Lynne.), and the fact that it was such a big pay cut made it a no-brainer to continue the process. Marie had an utterly stunned look on her face, and she said to me: &amp;quot;Pay cut?  You all were supposed to be kept at parity.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I found out later (through my mole Lynne) was that Jim neglected to relay that instruction to company HR when they were preparing the offer letters.  They prepared the offers at what HR deemed to be market rate, which in this case was a substantial pay hit. I never found out if he did that on purpose, but given that he&amp;#39;d complained in the past that he thought we were overpaid for what we did, I&amp;#39;d be willing to hazard a guess that he did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even though Marie upped the offer to match my current pay rate (so much for take it or leave it) and promised that I&amp;#39;d be reporting to her given my past history with Jim, I still declined as my new job had a lot more long term opportunity.  I ended up taking the job at the telco, just long enough to work out my notice period. HR was &lt;em&gt;VERY&lt;/em&gt; confused at my exit interview when they noticed that I&amp;#39;d been with the company for only 9 working days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I ended up staying at CoolTechCompany for over 8 years. It was the best career move I ever made. My only regret about it was that I was never able to get Lynne a job there.  On the other hand, Marie stepped in and took away all of Jim&amp;#39;s supervisory responsibility over the sysadmins, sticking him in a strict technical role.  He lasted a few months after that and bailed out to a much smaller company. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 125, "id": "award_5f123e3d-4f48-42f4-9c11-e98b566d5897", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=082e8a6ce98b1d4a23352a066805ad80c4613ef0", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b3a82cbce99aee9ab58568a6deaecfb665b8c23e", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2efd28f79c4ecd09f21aa3d215e8581027425ed4", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a2c69f0958d075865c5ef5de68e6cafdbc8e8b0", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3b9381ef976af3298b22fc5103c37e9217c3a50b", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "When you come across a feel-good thing.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "Wholesome", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=082e8a6ce98b1d4a23352a066805ad80c4613ef0", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b3a82cbce99aee9ab58568a6deaecfb665b8c23e", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2efd28f79c4ecd09f21aa3d215e8581027425ed4", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a2c69f0958d075865c5ef5de68e6cafdbc8e8b0", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3b9381ef976af3298b22fc5103c37e9217c3a50b", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5izbv4fn0md41_Wholesome.png"}], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "621lif", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Blempglorf", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 490, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/621lif/how_i_quit_after_i_got_fired_and_unfired/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/621lif/how_i_quit_after_i_got_fired_and_unfired/", "subreddit_subscribers": 767512, "created_utc": 1490729308.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "selftext": "I witnessed this astounding IT meltdown around 2004 in a large academic organization.\n\nAn employee decided to send a broad solicitation about her need for a local apartment.

He was one of those \"I'm a very busy and a very important man, and I don't have time to follow your troubleshooting steps over the phone.  Just fix it, dammit.\" kinda guys, so he said he would get someone to drop off the laptop at our office and pick up a loaner.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe received the laptop a couple days later, there was a note attached saying that now it wasn't even booting into Windows anymore.

Like many industries, we had a number of machines with embedded computer systems. For the sake of convenience, we called these \"production machines\", because they produce stuff. By and large, these PC's are just normal desktop PC's that have a bunch of data acquisition cards in them connected to a PLC, or a second network card connected to an ethernet capable PLC. Invariably these PC's are purchased and configured when this production machine is being commissioned, and then just left as is until the production machine is retired... In some cases, this can be as long as 20 years. Please bear in mind that this is 20 years inside a dusty, hot factory environment.\n\n\nI've been in manufacturing environments before, and this concept is not new to me. Thanks to a number of poignant lessons in the past, I make it my business to understand these PC's inside and out. I like to keep them on a tight refresh cycle, or when it's not practical (in the case of archaic hardware or software), keep as many spares as possible. Also, regular backups are important - you just have to understand that unlike a normal PC, it can be difficult to do and plan it well in advance. More often than not, these PC's aren't IT's responsibility - they fall under engineering or facilities. Even so, these guys understand that IT runs just about every other PC in the business, and welcome any advice or assistance that IT can provide. Finally, these PC's are usually tightly integrated into a production machine, and failure of the PC means the machine stops.\n\n\nAnd so we have today's stars:\n\nAirzone: Me, the new IT manager. \n\nTooExpensive: The site's facilities manager. He's in charge of the maintenance of the site, including all of these production machines. He's super paranoid about people trying to take his job, so he guards all his responsibilities jealously and doesn't communicate anything lest they get the drop on his efforts. Oh, and he has a fixation about not spending company money - even to the point of shafting the lawn-mowing guy out of a few hours pay - hence the name.\n\nVPO: Vice president of operations. The factory boss. No nonsense sort of guy.\n\nOldBoy: We'll get to him, but his name is derived from being a man in his 70's.\n\n\nI'm new, but in my first few weeks I've already had a number of run-ins with TooExpensive. I'm a fairly relaxed guy, but I have no qualms about letting someone dig their own grave and fall into it - and in the case of TooExpensive, I'd be happy to lend him my shovel. My pet hate was when organising new network drops, I will always run a double when we needed a single. We're paying working-at-heights money already, and a double drop is material cost only. i.e. Adding $50 - $100 material on a $4000 single drop cost. He'd invariably countermand all my orders and insist on singles. And then a few weeks / months later, I'd have the sparkie in again to install the second drop, at another $4k.\n\nAnd then there was the time that he was getting shirty because I was holding up a project of his.. Well sorry, if you are running a project that requires 12 - 16 network ports, you'd better at least talk to the IT guys prior to the day of installation. Not only will you not have drops, you won't have switch ports. And if you didn't budget for them, or advise far enough in advance that I could, then you can wait until I get around to it. Failure to plan is not an emergency.\n\nSo you could see that we didn't exactly gel together well.\n\nWhich brings us to these production machines, and the PC's nested within. Every attempt for me to try and document, or even understand  them was shut down by TooExpensive. \n\n&gt; *Me*: Hardware and software specifications? \n\n&gt; *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. \n\n&gt; *Me*: Startup and shutdown procedures? \n\n&gt; *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost. \n\n&gt; *Me*: Backup? \n\n&gt; *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.\n\n&gt; *Me*: Emergency contacts? \n\n&gt; *TooExpensive*: That's my job, get lost.\n\n\nYou get the picture. It resulted in a strong and terse email from TooExpensive to leave it alone. He had all the documentation, contacts, backups, and didn't need, or want my meddling, and I was not to touch any production machine's PC under any circumstance.\n\nMove forward a few months and I'm helping one of the factory workers on their area's shared PC. It's located right next to one of these production machines. It's old. The machine itself was nearly an antique, but the controls system had been \"recently\" upgraded. It had co-ax network of 2 PC's - one NT4 primary domain controller, and a NT4 workstation, and a network PLC (also on co-ax). The machines were pentiums running the minimum specs for NT4 to run, with a control application whose application logic was configured entirely through a propriety database. I had actually seen this software in a different company, so I had some basic familiarity with it. The co-ax was terminated on a hub with a few cat5 ports on it to connect to our LAN and an old hp laserjet printer. These particular production machines are rare, only a few of them exist in the world. We bought this one from a company that had gone out of business a few years earlier.\n\nIt was test&amp;tag day and TooExpensive was running around a sparkie to do the testing. My earlier instruction to the sparkie was to not disconnect any computer equipment if it was not powered off. And so it came time to test this production machine's PC. The sparkie wasn't going to touch it while it was on. Luckily TooExpensive came prepared with his thoroughly documented shutdown procedure: yank the power cords. The test passed, new labels were applied to the power cord, he plugged it back in and turned it back on, then ran off to his next conquest without waiting for the boot to finish.\n\n10 minutes later, the machine operator starts grumbling. I have a quick peek, and see that the control software had started, but the screen was garbled and none of the right measurements were showing. TooExpensive is called over, and he talked one look, pales, and then runs off. \n\n10 minutes later, the operator looks at me and asks for help. I call TooExpensive's mobile, and it's off. I called VPO's mobile and suggest that he comes over immediately.\n\n10 minutes later, the operator, VPO, and I are looking at this machine. It's fucked. There's the better part of a million dollars worth of product to be processed by this machine, and the nearest alternate machine is in Singapore, belonging to a different company. And if the processing isn't done within soon, the product will expire and be scrapped. 40% of revenue is from product processed by this machine. We're fucked.\n\n10 minutes later, we still can't get onto TooExpensive. We can't talk to him about the \"backups\" or any emergency contacts that he knows about. We can't even get his phone to ring.\n\nSo as I have said, I have used this software before and have a basic understanding. I know enough that the configuration is everything, and configuration is matched to the machine. But I also knew a guy who did some of the implementations. A call to him gave me a lead, and I followed the leads until about 4 calls later, I had the guy who implemented this particular machine. OldBoy had retired 10 years earlier, but VPO had persuaded him to come out of retirement for an eyewatering sum of money.\n\nA few hours later, OldBoy took one look at the machine and confirmed that the database was fucked. We'd need to restore it from backup. TooExpensive is still not contactable.\n\n&gt; *Me*: Let's assume for a moment that there is no backup. What do we need to do.\n\n&gt; *OldBoy*: Normally I'd say pray, buy you must have done that already because I haven't kicked the bucket yet.\n\nTo cut a long story short, we had to rebuild the database. But not from scratch. OldBoy's MO was when setting up a machine, when he was done, he'd create and store a backup database on the machine. The only issue was that 20 years of machine updates needed to be worked out. It also just so happens that through sheer effort, I am able to compare a corrupted database file to a good one, and fool with it enough to get it to load in the configuration editor. It's still mangled, but we are able to use that as a reference to build the lost config. \n\nAll up, it took 4 days to bring this machine back online. But we did. To be honest, I certainly wasn't capable of doing this solo, and without my efforts to patch the corrupted database file, OldBoy would not have been able to restore 20 years of patches that we had no documentation for.\n\nAnd what of TooExpensive?\n\nAfter OldBoy and I started working on the problem, he showed up again. He ignored any advice about a backup (because obviously there wasn't any), and instead demanded regular status updates for him to report to VPO. The little shit had screwed up the machine, run off to hide, and now a solution was in progress, was trying to claim the credit.\n\nWhen it was all running again, OldBoy debriefed VPO on the solution. I then had my turn with VPO.\n\n&gt; *VPO*: So Airzone. Thanks for your help. Your efforts have un-fucked us. \n\n&gt; *Me*: No worries.\n\n&gt; *VPO*: And now we get to the unpleasant bit. TooExpensive claims that you didn't follow procedure when shutting down the machine, causing it to crash. He also claims that you hadn't taken any backups, and it was effectively your fault.\n\n&gt; *Me*: And when we tried to call him?\n\n&gt; *VPO*: He claims he was busy contacting his emergency contacts.\n\n&gt; *Me*: I see.\n\n&gt; *VPO*: I don't believe a word of that shit. Unfortunately it's your word vs his. If I had the evidence, I'd fire him.\n\n&gt; *Me*: *(opening the email TooExpensive had sent me about meddling on my phone)* You mean this evidence?\n\n\nHalf an hour later, I got the call to lock TooExpensive's account and disabled his access card.\n\n\nEdit: Wow, this story seems to have resonated with so many people here..

Your efforts have un-fucked us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: No worries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VPO&lt;/em&gt;: And now we get to the unpleasant bit. TooExpensive claims that you didn&amp;#39;t follow procedure when shutting down the machine, causing it to crash. He also claims that you hadn&amp;#39;t taken any backups, and it was effectively your fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: And when we tried to call him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VPO&lt;/em&gt;: He claims he was busy contacting his emergency contacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: I see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VPO&lt;/em&gt;: I don&amp;#39;t believe a word of that shit. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s your word vs his. If I had the evidence, I&amp;#39;d fire him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;(opening the email TooExpensive had sent me about meddling on my phone)&lt;/em&gt; You mean this evidence?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, I got the call to lock TooExpensive&amp;#39;s account and disabled his access card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Wow, this story seems to have resonated with so many people here..

Plus reduced turn around time on broken RF guns by actually looking at how to repair them and which of the parts from the old guns being replaced were compatible with the new models. \n\n I presented all of this to him and the following week I was notified by my contract manager they were letting me go. Fine with that really as seasonal was coming up and the no drug test or background check hires were the worst each year. Two days later I get a call from the manager demanding the scripts I used. While at the job they never provided me with any tools and they told us to use our own if we needed it. I had never put the scripts on the server or on my work computer. I check my contracts for any clause for files or documents I create while on the job and then proceeded to tell him they were not worth me keeping my job, so I deleted them when requested to dormat my drive upon termination, but they could keep my screwdriver set in my drawer so they can have one in the office.\n\nFor those who cant keep up.\nScripts were made on my own time off the clock talking to software vendors cause they are closed during  my night shift.

This is another story i've already posted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Friday morning 8:00 am I'm sitting around waiting for a ticket/something to do.  I get a call in that a computer can't login. There's no ticket because.. well they can't log in to start a ticket. Entirely understandable. The computer is network login, so there's 1000 different things it can be. Heck it could just be unplugged and not turning on. Y'al know how users can be.\n\n  \nI head up to their cubicle and start checking, everything is plugged in, the computer turns on and  there's no internet. I switch her network cord with her neighbhors to check the cord/everything upstream, her neighbors computer connects with her jack. I log into the local admin account and there's no internet connection or network connection at  all. Check device manager and there's the problem. The driver for the onboard network got corrupted *or  something*, can't roll it back either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreat, this means I need authorization from cyber security to use a flash drive, and then I'll need to tear the computer apart to get to a USB port that is hidden inside the case that isn't superglued. Now the key for the case requires my supervisor to sign off on it and give me the key for the case lock, as well I have to write up the ticket and put it into the system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI run down to the bat cave and download the driver for her computer and  email it to my boss, with a note to stick it on a thumb drive. And then walk to his desk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey boss I emailed you a network driver I need on a thumb drive, I also need you to submit my authorization form to cyber Sec for the use of a portable storage device\" (yes that really is two forms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we sent the form off to cyber security to authorize.\n\nrequest for USB  storage device usage,\n\nTime estimated on the work: 15 minutes\n\nreason: copying network drivers to get the computer back on the network\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf an hour later, no response. Head of IT calls down to cyber security to get an  ETA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10 minutes later the request comes back as denied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReason : Just email the file\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we got the biggest Idiot ever reviewing the request... she has a tendency to just completely drop the ball, before they took the job in Cyber security she had neither experience in Cyber security, nor any basic understanding of IT. But it's OK, she can haphazardly enforce rules she doesn't understand and she spends her day helping idiots reset their passwords using the password reset tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my boss has to call her and explain the situation. After half 5 minutes on the phone he has to go upstairs to the boss of cyber security and explain why she's an idiot today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf an hour later the approval comes from cybersecurity comes in to my email and my boss texts me to grab the form from him, and his spare keys and USB drive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Now I have ***both*** authorization forms and I return to the woman's desk. She left a note for me that she's making a starbucks run and will be back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I power down her computer and turn it on it's side so I can get it open to plug the USB in. I'm standing there fiddling with the flash drive and someone yanks it out of my hand tosses it to the floor and he starts stomping on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What the hell are you doing?\"\n\n\"USB devices are banned\" he replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"WHOAH WHOAH.. first of all I have an authorization form from cyber security.. Second of all that's company property, and third of all, you just destroyed evidence\" I tell the idiot. So I call my boss and he's still in cyber securities office, or water cooler/breakroom as I explain what went down.\n\n  \nCyber security overhears this exchange. Cyber security decides to open a file on mishandling of suspect data. AKA smashing evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround about 11:00 am my boss comes back to the users desk with a different flash drive and the drivers for the network adapter and another stack of new forms for him to do the work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent an hour with cyber security filing out paper work about the destruction of a $5.00 flash drive, giving my statement on the data mishandling, and my statement responding to the accusation of using a USB storage device.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it took  3 hours and 15 minutes of 2 techs time (including the head of IT) to reinstall *a* ***network driver***.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now they have to pay a data recovery specialist god only knows how much to try to recover nothing of any value on a $5.00 flash drive, to prove there was nothing malicious on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and I'm on paid leave because they don't know **for certain** what's on the flash drive. Cyber security told me that as long as data recovery finds what I said is on it, or can't find anything, that i'm in the clear.  If the drive hadn't been smashed cyber security could/would have just looked at the USB drive and looked at what is on the drive. Should have taken like 8 seconds to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead I can collect pay checks until the data recovery experts take a few cracks at the USB drive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the good news is that I got to go home early on a Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I get a long weekend... maybe I'll binge watch Stargate.", "author_fullname": "t2_6xbbdslr", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Why I'm on paid leave over a $5.00 flash drive, with nothing of value on it, getting smashed", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_slkcos", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9019, "total_awards_received": 20, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9019, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 5, "gid_2": 1, "gid_3": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1644104921.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some back information, I work for a corporation and or institution where users handle enough information to be able to commit at least 2-3 felonies for every little query they touch (which isn&amp;#39;t THAT hard to imagine), as such they have a lot of policies that seem like extreme overkill, But on some level I agree with the attempt, the actual application of the rules I think borders on insanity but the attempts aren&amp;#39;t all complete failures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So some info you need to know, there&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; USB connector inside the case.

The kind that knows where all the obscure, undocumented insider stuff is and can fix most problems in 5 seconds that the rest of us might take hours to solve.\n\nOne of the guys in particular, who I shall refer to as Joe, a bearded and jovial gent with a very Steve Wozniak persona was always happy for us to approach him with our questions and welcomed us to leverage his VAST knowledge of how the company's sprawling IT infrastructure worked to make our lives easier and cope with the constant unrealistic expectations of upper management. He was a real, old-school engineer - someone who loved their job and was well respected by everyone around the department. So when his friend the current department head, a man of comparable knowledge and experience retired and was replaced from the outside with a young and brash one with a business degree and little technical knowledge who was also called Joe it was a big change for everyone. Fortunately for us he didn't interfere too much with the technical aspects of our day to day jobs. At least at first.\n\nWhen the company first started out they weren't too concerned with formality when it came to e-mail address policy. In later years as the company had grown they tightened the bolts with an official policy of issuing staff with a more formal address of [Firstname.Lastname@department.countrycode.company.com](mailto:Firstname.Lastname@department.company.com) but those who were around from the early days retained their original [name@company.com](mailto:name@company.com) addresses as an alias. It was somewhat of a status symbol  and sign of authority in the company to have one and those that did would use that version as their sending address and proudly have it in their e-mail signatures and on their business cards. The retired head had one such address, as did joe in the form of [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) and you always knew when you saw an e-mail come into the inbox from somebody with one of these addresses that they were someone important who had been around for a while. Most of the department heads were long term employees who used them and it wasn't long before the new IT head noticed this aspect of our corporate culture and clearly envied his peers. But as a new employee he was stuck with his formal e-mail address and they weren't issuing new legacy e-mail addresses of this kind unless they were for someone way up the food chain. Even as head of IT he had no authority to claim one which is why when one day he spotted an e-mail from Joe using his legacy address he saw an opportunity to get what he was coveting.\n\nSo as the tale goes, he called Joe into his office and had an exchange that went something like this:\n\n*IT Head: \"Hey Joe, great work on the capacity report and getting it to me so quickly we should be able to get approval from finance to expand our storage way sooner than I thought\"*\n\n*Joe: \"Not a problem, is there anything else you needed from me for it?\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"Nope, everything is there thanks. But I happened to notice when you sent it through you were using a different e-mail address a little different from the rest of the team.\"*\n\n*Joe: \"Yes, that's the one I've always used from when I started and everyone here knows to reach me at. Also some of our older systems and scripts we still use from the early days were hard coded to use it as well so I'm still actively using it to get critical alerts and I've got rules set up to forward them on to the relevant team addresses we use these days since the only alternative is to budget a major project to go through all our legacy stuff to change it and we were never able to get approval for that with everything else going on around here.\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"I've got no problem with that but I was interested in getting one of those kind of addresses for me, it would make it easier for people to, you know, know I'm the head of this department rather than just another employee here. My predecessor had one so it should be no problem for me to have one as well too, right? Can you make that happen?\"*\n\n*Joe: \"I'm sorry, I wish I could but it's HR that makes that decision and it's their policy is to only issue personal addresses at the top corporate domain level now for C level recruits and their immediate assistants.\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"You've been here for a long time, surely there isn't a way or someone you know who can make this happen?\"*\n\n*Joe: \"I'm sorry, it's a decision way above my pay grade. I'd be happy to put a request in for you to the head of HR to see if they could do it as a favor but I'm pretty certain what their answer will be.\"*\n\n*IT Head: (Annoyed) \"Ok thanks, do it and let's see what happens\"*\n\nJoe goes and logs the request but of course the head of HR knocks it back, citing policy and not wanting to set a precedent even as a favor to Joe. Joe goes back to give the IT Head the bad news:\n\n*Joe: (Knocks) \"Hey, you know that request I put through to try and get you a top level e-mail address? Unfortunately HR have knocked it back, I did my best to try and push it through but they were firm on our current corporate policy of not issuing any new ones except for those at the very top.\"*\n\n*IT Head: (Visibly unhappy) \"I'm sorry to hear that, are you sure you did everything you could??\"*\n\n*Joe: \"Yes, it's out of either of our hands unfortunately.\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"Fine then\"*\n\nAnd Joe was right. There was no way the IT Head was going to be issued with a brand new personal address. However, his position did allow how to authorize the reassignment of existing e-mail addresses to staff which was normally used to forward mail and alerts still being sent internally to staff who had left the company. He soon realized this was possible and formed a plan, calling Joe back into his office for another conversation:\n\n*IT Head: \"Hey Joe, you know how we can't get new personal e-mail addresses created, but we can still reassign an existing one into my name, right?\"*\n\n*Joe: (Frowning) \"We can do that, yes. You have the authority to have the e-mail address of anyone who has left redirected or assigned to anyone else if you so wish, did you want your predecessor's address? I mean, we can do it but it would confuse a lot of people if they saw your e-mail coming from someone who is gone.\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"What about e-mail addresses of existing staff?\"*\n\n*Joe: (Frowning harder and seeing where this was going) \"You do have the authority, but it would still confuse people and you would be getting all the legacy alerts and notifications which would make you responsible for ensuring they flow through to the right people when they arrive\"*\n\n*IT Head: \"I think I can handle forwarding a couple of lousy e-mails whenever I see them. I have a greater need for visibility here and there is no business requirement for you to have one so start the process of transferring* [*joe@company.com*](mailto:joe@company.com) *across to me immediately. Let me know once it's done so I can let everyone know.\"*\n\nSo poor Joe was forced to dig his own grave and give up the e-mail address he had held since day one. He definitely wasn't happy about it but did as he was instructed. Falling back on his regular corporate address he sent an e-mail out to the immediate team and his contacts to let them know what was happening and to please use his full address moving forward to contact him. At the same time the IT Head proudly sent out a company-wide e-mail broadcast letting everyone know that his e-mail address had been updated and could now be reached at [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) as the Head of IT.\n\nWeeks went by and it was clear he was taking every opportunity to send out e-mails using his new address, new stationary was issued along with business cards clearly showing his position and contact address. He was clearly reveling in having a coveted address and the prestige and recognition it instantly gave him, especially when dealing with other offices and people who didn't know he was only a relative newcomer. Life was good, that is until one fateful morning when he wasn't in his office browsing Facebook like he usually would be doing when everyone else arrived.\n\nTurned out he had forgotten about his responsibility to forward through important notifications when they can through to him. He had set up a rule to handle them, sure, but not to forward them as promised but instead deleting them directly from his inbox without notice. One particular alert dealt with backup failures for a particularly important and long-term defense contract. One of our key SLAs was to ensure daily incremental and weekly full backups being performed on one of these old legacy systems that Joe had mentioned to him, both verbally and in writing. The media in an old backup unit had failed and was repeatedly notifying the issue. It was normally a simple fix, replace the faulty media in the backup unit and restart a full backup run but with no alerts being sent through nobody knew there was a problem. So when a request came through from the client to perform a restore of the previous week's data after an accidental deletion that backup team found, to their horror, that no backups had been running for the past several weeks and the data had been lost.\n\nThe client was not amused. The CEO with whom they had a close relationship was even less so. The IT Head attempted to throw Joe under the bus when word came down that the company was going to incur a MASSIVE rebate for the SLA breach, but Joe in his wisdom had ensured he had done a complete CYA when handing over his e-mail address, including e-mail exchanges with the IT Head highlighting the importance of the alerts and to ensure they went to the right people, including detailed instructions on how to set up forwarding rules and where to send them. All completely ignored. HR policy was specific when it came to important e-mail, it was the clear responsibility of the recipient to ensure they were handled accordingly and the IT Head had clearly failed in his accepted responsibilities. He didn't last probation, and was gone within the next month.\n\nEveryone was wondering who we would be getting in the position next, HR and management were tight lipped on the topic and there was plenty of speculation within the department about what might happen next. But everyone was smiling when they walked in on the Monday to see Joe sitting in the IT Head office, in the wake of what happened management decided in their wisdom that the IT Department should have a Head who actually knew something about IT and tapped Joe to take the seat. He hung on for a few more years before retiring or moving on but during his tenure he was one of the best IT managers I have ever worked for and the position didn't change him from being the friendly, helpful and supportive teacher that he was. I was sad to see him go but while he was still with us I always smiled when I saw his e-mails coming through to us from the old, friendly address of [joe@company.com](mailto:joe@company.com) which he had reclaimed and had been returned to it's rightful owner.", "author_fullname": "t2_ftgur", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "When a new IT department head steals the prestige e-mail address from long time employee and lives to regret it.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "epic", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_sho3kd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8736, "total_awards_received": 54, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Epic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8736, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 17, "gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643696594.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of years back I was working for a company that had been around for many years, I was only relatively new myself but there were still a couple of &amp;quot;old guard&amp;quot; senior engineers around who had been there from the start.

In later years as the company had grown they tightened the bolts with an official policy of issuing staff with a more formal address of [&lt;a href=\"mailto:Firstname.Lastname@department.countrycode.company.com\"&gt;Firstname.Lastname@department.countrycode.company.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:Firstname.Lastname@department.company.com\"&gt;Firstname.Lastname@department.company.com&lt;/a&gt;) but those who were around from the early days retained their original [&lt;a href=\"mailto:name@company.com\"&gt;name@company.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:name@company.com\"&gt;name@company.com&lt;/a&gt;) addresses as an alias. It was somewhat of a status symbol  and sign of authority in the company to have one and those that did would use that version as their sending address and proudly have it in their e-mail signatures and on their business cards. The retired head had one such address, as did joe in the form of [&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;) and you always knew when you saw an e-mail come into the inbox from somebody with one of these addresses that they were someone important who had been around for a while. Most of the department heads were long term employees who used them and it wasn&amp;#39;t long before the new IT head noticed this aspect of our corporate culture and clearly envied his peers. But as a new employee he was stuck with his formal e-mail address and they weren&amp;#39;t issuing new legacy e-mail addresses of this kind unless they were for someone way up the food chain. Even as head of IT he had no authority to claim one which is why when one day he spotted an e-mail from Joe using his legacy address he saw an opportunity to get what he was coveting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as the tale goes, he called Joe into his office and had an exchange that went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;Hey Joe, great work on the capacity report and getting it to me so quickly we should be able to get approval from finance to expand our storage way sooner than I thought&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: &amp;quot;Not a problem, is there anything else you needed from me for it?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;Nope, everything is there thanks. But I happened to notice when you sent it through you were using a different e-mail address a little different from the rest of the team.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: &amp;quot;Yes, that&amp;#39;s the one I&amp;#39;ve always used from when I started and everyone here knows to reach me at. Also some of our older systems and scripts we still use from the early days were hard coded to use it as well so I&amp;#39;m still actively using it to get critical alerts and I&amp;#39;ve got rules set up to forward them on to the relevant team addresses we use these days since the only alternative is to budget a major project to go through all our legacy stuff to change it and we were never able to get approval for that with everything else going on around here.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got no problem with that but I was interested in getting one of those kind of addresses for me, it would make it easier for people to, you know, know I&amp;#39;m the head of this department rather than just another employee here. My predecessor had one so it should be no problem for me to have one as well too, right? Can you make that happen?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I wish I could but it&amp;#39;s HR that makes that decision and it&amp;#39;s their policy is to only issue personal addresses at the top corporate domain level now for C level recruits and their immediate assistants.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been here for a long time, surely there isn&amp;#39;t a way or someone you know who can make this happen?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, it&amp;#39;s a decision way above my pay grade. I&amp;#39;d be happy to put a request in for you to the head of HR to see if they could do it as a favor but I&amp;#39;m pretty certain what their answer will be.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: (Annoyed) &amp;quot;Ok thanks, do it and let&amp;#39;s see what happens&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joe goes and logs the request but of course the head of HR knocks it back, citing policy and not wanting to set a precedent even as a favor to Joe. Joe goes back to give the IT Head the bad news:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: (Knocks) &amp;quot;Hey, you know that request I put through to try and get you a top level e-mail address? Unfortunately HR have knocked it back, I did my best to try and push it through but they were firm on our current corporate policy of not issuing any new ones except for those at the very top.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: (Visibly unhappy) &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear that, are you sure you did everything you could??&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: &amp;quot;Yes, it&amp;#39;s out of either of our hands unfortunately.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;Fine then&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Joe was right. There was no way the IT Head was going to be issued with a brand new personal address. However, his position did allow how to authorize the reassignment of existing e-mail addresses to staff which was normally used to forward mail and alerts still being sent internally to staff who had left the company. He soon realized this was possible and formed a plan, calling Joe back into his office for another conversation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;Hey Joe, you know how we can&amp;#39;t get new personal e-mail addresses created, but we can still reassign an existing one into my name, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: (Frowning) &amp;quot;We can do that, yes. You have the authority to have the e-mail address of anyone who has left redirected or assigned to anyone else if you so wish, did you want your predecessor&amp;#39;s address? I mean, we can do it but it would confuse a lot of people if they saw your e-mail coming from someone who is gone.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;What about e-mail addresses of existing staff?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe: (Frowning harder and seeing where this was going) &amp;quot;You do have the authority, but it would still confuse people and you would be getting all the legacy alerts and notifications which would make you responsible for ensuring they flow through to the right people when they arrive&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT Head: &amp;quot;I think I can handle forwarding a couple of lousy e-mails whenever I see them. I have a greater need for visibility here and there is no business requirement for you to have one so start the process of transferring&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;across to me immediately. Let me know once it&amp;#39;s done so I can let everyone know.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So poor Joe was forced to dig his own grave and give up the e-mail address he had held since day one. He definitely wasn&amp;#39;t happy about it but did as he was instructed. Falling back on his regular corporate address he sent an e-mail out to the immediate team and his contacts to let them know what was happening and to please use his full address moving forward to contact him. At the same time the IT Head proudly sent out a company-wide e-mail broadcast letting everyone know that his e-mail address had been updated and could now be reached at [&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;) as the Head of IT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weeks went by and it was clear he was taking every opportunity to send out e-mails using his new address, new stationary was issued along with business cards clearly showing his position and contact address. He was clearly reveling in having a coveted address and the prestige and recognition it instantly gave him, especially when dealing with other offices and people who didn&amp;#39;t know he was only a relative newcomer. Life was good, that is until one fateful morning when he wasn&amp;#39;t in his office browsing Facebook like he usually would be doing when everyone else arrived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turned out he had forgotten about his responsibility to forward through important notifications when they can through to him. He had set up a rule to handle them, sure, but not to forward them as promised but instead deleting them directly from his inbox without notice. One particular alert dealt with backup failures for a particularly important and long-term defense contract. One of our key SLAs was to ensure daily incremental and weekly full backups being performed on one of these old legacy systems that Joe had mentioned to him, both verbally and in writing. The media in an old backup unit had failed and was repeatedly notifying the issue. It was normally a simple fix, replace the faulty media in the backup unit and restart a full backup run but with no alerts being sent through nobody knew there was a problem. So when a request came through from the client to perform a restore of the previous week&amp;#39;s data after an accidental deletion that backup team found, to their horror, that no backups had been running for the past several weeks and the data had been lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The client was not amused. The CEO with whom they had a close relationship was even less so. The IT Head attempted to throw Joe under the bus when word came down that the company was going to incur a MASSIVE rebate for the SLA breach, but Joe in his wisdom had ensured he had done a complete CYA when handing over his e-mail address, including e-mail exchanges with the IT Head highlighting the importance of the alerts and to ensure they went to the right people, including detailed instructions on how to set up forwarding rules and where to send them. All completely ignored. HR policy was specific when it came to important e-mail, it was the clear responsibility of the recipient to ensure they were handled accordingly and the IT Head had clearly failed in his accepted responsibilities. He didn&amp;#39;t last probation, and was gone within the next month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone was wondering who we would be getting in the position next, HR and management were tight lipped on the topic and there was plenty of speculation within the department about what might happen next. But everyone was smiling when they walked in on the Monday to see Joe sitting in the IT Head office, in the wake of what happened management decided in their wisdom that the IT Department should have a Head who actually knew something about IT and tapped Joe to take the seat. He hung on for a few more years before retiring or moving on but during his tenure he was one of the best IT managers I have ever worked for and the position didn&amp;#39;t change him from being the friendly, helpful and supportive teacher that he was. I was sad to see him go but while he was still with us I always smiled when I saw his e-mails coming through to us from the old, friendly address of [&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:joe@company.com\"&gt;joe@company.com&lt;/a&gt;) which he had reclaimed and had been returned to it&amp;#39;s rightful owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false,

It's used by pastors to download material to use in their church services. We support the following browsers -keep in mind this is probably ~~2002/2003~~ 2006 (thanks /u/gargarlord and /u/BCdotWHAT):\n\n* Internet Explorer for Windows\n\n* Internet Explorer for Mac\n\nIf you've never heard of Internet Explorer for Mac, be grateful. Anyway, Chrome did not yet exist, and Firefox either didn't, or was super early on and not that great. Then something happened. Microsoft killed IE for Mac. I don't mean they just stopped developing it. They pulled the download links, and more or less pretended it didn't exist. If you didn't already have it, there was no way to get it - if there was some sort of abandonware website or other repository for old software back then, I didn't know about it and couldn't find it.\n\nOur Mac browser support remained the same: IE only.\n\n&gt;$Customer: Hi, I'm having some trouble with your website.\n\n&gt;$Me: What browser are you using?\n\n&gt;$Customer: Safari\n\n&gt;$Me, through gritted teeth: Unfortunately we don't support Safari. You'll need to use Internet Explorer.\n\n&gt;$Customer: Oh, how do I get that?\n\n&gt;$Me: You can't.\n\n&gt;$Customer: ...what?\n\n&gt;$Me: We only support Internet Explorer on Macs. If you have a Windows computer, you can use that. If not, you'll need to get Internet Explorer.\n\n&gt;$Customer: Ok...this is my only computer, so how do I get it?\n\n&gt;$Me: You can't. They no longer make it. It's not available anywhere.\n\n&gt;$Customer: So how do I use your website that I'm paying for?\n\n&gt;$Me: You can't.\n\n&gt;$Customer: Do you not see the problem here?\n\n&gt;$Me: Ok look, maybe we can help each other out here. We really should support Safari, but we don't. There's no other option. If possible, can you please write me an email, and be as upset as you can - swear, threaten to cancel, threaten to sue, whatever you can. I'll take it to the powers that be and try to get this fixed for you.\n\n&gt;$Customer: You want me to swear? I'm a pastor!\n\n&gt;$Me: I know. Look, it's Thursday afternoon. Getting this pushed through before Sunday isn't going to be easy.\n\n&gt;$Customer: I'm sure God will understand.\n\nSo I get this email from him, and it's everything I asked for - ranting and raving about how we're preventing him from doing God's work. Thankfully, he didn't complain about me at all. I take it to the web development team - same $Dev as in the previous story linked above.\n\n&gt;$Dev: So what's not working?\n\n&gt;$Me: [problem I can no longer remember]\n\n&gt;$Dev: I'm pretty sure it works. [Opens Safari and tests successfully.]\n\n&gt;$Me: Wait, we don't support Safari.\n\n&gt;$Dev, rolling eyes: I know. It works great, it's what I use all the time, faster than IE. But [$VP of something or other] won't approve the 30 minutes it'll take me to fix it for newer versions of Safari. I just don't upgrade mine so I can use it.\n\nThankfully, I had just helped $VP with a weird problem with his computer, and he was super grateful. I walked over to his office, and he happened to be free. It was about 3pm on a Thursday, and we closed at 4.\n&gt;$Me: Sorry to bug you, but...well, you should read this.\nHe reads the email, and his eyes go wide.\n\n&gt;$VP: This is from one of our customers?\n\n&gt;$Me: Yeah, he was trying to finish his sermon for Sunday and-\n\nI didn't even finish my sentence before he was calling $Dev's manager. By 4:45, our website officially supported Safari and I was on the phone with $Customer to deliver the good news.\n\nI'd like to think God understood.\n", "author_fullname": "t2_zcl42", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I'm sorry, we only support browsers that don't exist", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "all medium", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_5maaym", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8678, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Medium r/ALL", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8678, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1483727886.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1483662810.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same company and website as previous tale here:\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ltdyz/why_consistent_password_policies_are_important/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ltdyz/why_consistent_password_policies_are_important/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s this website used by a few thousand paying customers - something like $200/year.

You&amp;#39;ll need to use Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: Oh, how do I get that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: You can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: ...what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: We only support Internet Explorer on Macs. If you have a Windows computer, you can use that. If not, you&amp;#39;ll need to get Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: Ok...this is my only computer, so how do I get it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: You can&amp;#39;t. They no longer make it. It&amp;#39;s not available anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: So how do I use your website that I&amp;#39;m paying for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: You can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: Do you not see the problem here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Ok look, maybe we can help each other out here. We really should support Safari, but we don&amp;#39;t. There&amp;#39;s no other option. If possible, can you please write me an email, and be as upset as you can - swear, threaten to cancel, threaten to sue, whatever you can. I&amp;#39;ll take it to the powers that be and try to get this fixed for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: You want me to swear? I&amp;#39;m a pastor!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: I know. Look, it&amp;#39;s Thursday afternoon. Getting this pushed through before Sunday isn&amp;#39;t going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Customer: I&amp;#39;m sure God will understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I get this email from him, and it&amp;#39;s everything I asked for - ranting and raving about how we&amp;#39;re preventing him from doing God&amp;#39;s work. Thankfully, he didn&amp;#39;t complain about me at all. I take it to the web development team - same $Dev as in the previous story linked above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Dev: So what&amp;#39;s not working?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: [problem I can no longer remember]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Dev: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it works. [Opens Safari and tests successfully.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Wait, we don&amp;#39;t support Safari.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Dev, rolling eyes: I know. It works great, it&amp;#39;s what I use all the time, faster than IE. But [$VP of something or other] won&amp;#39;t approve the 30 minutes it&amp;#39;ll take me to fix it for newer versions of Safari. I just don&amp;#39;t upgrade mine so I can use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had just helped $VP with a weird problem with his computer, and he was super grateful. I walked over to his office, and he happened to be free. It was about 3pm on a Thursday, and we closed at 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Sorry to bug you, but...well, you should read this.\nHe reads the email, and his eyes go wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$VP: This is from one of our customers?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$Me: Yeah, he was trying to finish his sermon for Sunday and-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even finish my sentence before he was calling $Dev&amp;#39;s manager. By 4:45, our website officially supported Safari and I was on the phone with $Customer to deliver the good news.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to think God understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "5maaym", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Ankthar_LeMarre", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 391, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5maaym/im_sorry_we_only_support_browsers_that_dont_exist/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5maaym/im_sorry_we_only_support_browsers_that_dont_exist/", "subreddit_subscribers": 767512, "created_utc": 1483662810.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "selftext": "backstory - I do end user implementation, training, and support for a web application that was developed by my firm.

Eventually he put up his hand to motion the supervisor come talk to the customer.\n\nRight then the owner of the company happened to be walking by with another one of the execs. I've met the guy a few times at the company social events and he is a really down to earth employee friendly boss. He asked what the issue was with his customer and after it was explained he took the headset and picked up the line.\n\nAfter listening for about 4-5 minutes he said very flatly \"That's never going to happen, especially not when you have an attitude like a 13 year old girl.\" Again listening for a minutes before he said \"I don't have a manager. I own this company and I don't have to listen to this s..t from an a..hole like you and neither do my employees. I'm terminating your account with us.\"\n\nHe hung up and I watched him disable this guys account and add a note to the file. \"Customer is an a..hole. Do not reinstate account - Boss\". Then he just handed back the headset and carried on about his day.\n\nedit: since so many people have asked the issue the guy was going nuts about was something to do with a delay in testing for a fault on his line; something that is done by the phone company and not by the ISP. We literally have nothing to do with it other than submitting the request for testing to them.

Sorry about that.\n\nWhat follows is a story that comes from my first few months at [medium-sized company]. I previously posted here to tell [a story about the time I poisoned a user] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5gujya/you_poisoned_my_keyboard/), and [another story about that time I stealthily upgraded users to Windows 7 by moonlight (now with a working post)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ypxhl/windows_xp_and_old_pos_software_vs_my_boss/).\n\nSo anyway.\n\nI was a tier 1 phone jockey and this was my first \u201cadult job\u201d after college, so you can imagine how surprised and nervous I was when one day I get an email with the subject line \u201cFWD: DISABLE FACEBOOK NOW!!\u201d \n\nIt was written just like that- in all caps, two (or maybe three) exclamation points. Inside, there was a long message chain containing an extended rant from our marketing executive (MKT), sent to the CEO, replied to, forwarded to the CIO, replied to, forwarded to my manager, and then kicked down to me with no explanation.\n\nMy manager did this kind of thing a lot- rather than open a ticket in the ticketing system he insisted we use a certain way, or explain anything in his emails, he would simply forward us an email chain of a conversation he\u2019d been having with some store or department manager, some executive, or some vender, and we\u2019d have to read through all of it to figure out what he wanted. \n\nThis email was one of those. And since it had come from people up the chain from him, I had to read through all of his pathetic groveling and deferential boot-licking to reach the part where he made his unqualified promises about what I\u2019ll do in how much time. \n\nEventually, I surmised the following:\n\n-MKT is upset that his employees are spending work time on social media.\n\n-He has decided that this is all IT\u2019s fault.\n\n-He wants social media \"disabled on ALL computers.\" \n\n-He sent this complaint to the CEO, because it\u2019s not good enough to contact IT and open a ticket to get something done, he has to try to get someone fired while he\u2019s at it.\n\nOkay, fine. We actually had Websense, so I wrote up a ticket, opened up the admin console in Websense, and added Facebook\u2019s URL to the blacklist. Done and done. \n\nI reply-alled to the message chain and let the executives know that we\u2019re good. Immediately I got hammered with replies from the CEO, my manager, and MKT (who had made the request). They all wanted to know why I disabled Facebook on *their* machines.\n\nExercising all the restraint I had, I apologized and explained that when they said \u201cdisable Facebook on ALL computers\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that they meant for there to be exceptions to the rule.\n\nI grabbed one of our Tier-3 guys and he helped me set up MAC filtering in Websense. We made a group for the executives and managers to be excepted from the social media blackout, and then blocked twitter, instagram, and all the other common social media sites while we were at it.\n\nThinking the issue has now been properly dealt with, I updated the executives, who seem placated, updated the ticket, and then closed it.\n\n15 minutes later, a red-faced young woman (SMM) appeared in the IT office. She\u2019s from marketing and was upset because she couldn\u2019t reach Facebook or Twitter. I gently explained that those had just been blocked at the request of her department\u2019s exec.\n\nSMM: \u201cBut you\u2019re NOT supposed to block ME! I\u2019m a social media manager! It\u2019s MY JOB to be on FACEBOOK. NOW I CAN\u2019T WORK!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOh. Hang on.\u201d\n\nI placed a quick speakerphone call to MKT and got his admin assistant (AA).\n\nAA: \u201cMKT\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, can I speak with MKT? It\u2019s about the Facebook blackout he requested.\u201d\n\nAA: \u201cOoh yeah, he\u2019s pretty upset about that.\u201d\n\nOf course.\n\nMe: \u201cCan I speak to him?\u201d\n\nAfter a minute, she got him on the line.\n\nMKT: \u201cRathwood! Glad you finally got it right.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSir? SMM is in my office right now.\u201d\n\nMKT: \u201cSo? Tell her to get back to work.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSir, she can\u2019t. She says it\u2019s her job to run the company\u2019s social media pages and she can\u2019t work now because of the block. Do I have your permission to unblock her?\u201d\n\nMKT: \u201c...\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c...\u201d\n\nMKT: \u201cYou mean we\u2019re paying someone to be on Facebook?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c...she works for your department, sir.\u201d\n\nMKT: \u201cUnblock her for now, and tell her to come see me in my office.\u201d\n\nMe: \"Okay.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nI turned to look at SMM, and she was already walking out.\n\nME: \u201cHey- are you alright?\u201d\n\nShe turned back to me. \n\nSMM: \u201cI\u2019m fine.

This one is from way back when, about six years ago now, when I was in an entirely different career and halfway around the world. No salad dressing this time, and I'm sure you're all disappointed.\n\nOn a certain class of military warship, there is a place. The bridge may be in control of where the ship goes, but Damage Control Central is in charge of how fast it is getting there and whether or not it arrives in one piece. It's run by a high-ranking officer from Reactor Department (EW) and his two cronies, one that monitors the ship's water usage and one that monitors the ship's electrical usage (hi) These three people can bring 97K+ tons of steel and sadness to a halt. Behind them are a small pile of engineering folk, literally the ship's tech support branch. People could call DCC and report a problem (from an out light to a fire), and between all of us in there, we had the knowledge, skill, authority, and political clout to get a response team out. A lot of people didn't know what kind of authority DCC held, or exactly who they were talking to when they called down. This made for some very entertaining conversations.\n\nOne evening, the engineering folk get a call. One female sailor picks it up and naturally, we all listen in, because if it's a fire or something, we all need to respond as rapidly as possible. From our POV, this is how the conversation goes:\n\n&gt;Eng: DCC, Eng speaking.  \n&gt;Eng: The heater doesn't work?  \n&gt;Eng: Oh, yeah, that's normal.  \n&gt;Eng: No, we can't turn it up.  \n&gt;Eng: What? No, we can't replace it, we're in the middle of the Persian Gulf, where are we going to get another one?  \n&gt;Eng: Look, it works fine. Take shorter showers.  \n&gt;Eng: Your division can put in a request for a bigger one when we get back to home port, but you're not getting one now.  \n&gt;Eng: Yeah, no, I'm not ordering one. Replacing those things is beyond the scope of what we're allowed to do underway.  \n&gt;Eng: Because policy.  \n&gt;Eng: Okay. You do that. We'll be waiting. Make sure you request permission to enter.  \n\nWith that, she hangs up. Naturally, we're all staring. She grins at us.\n\n&gt;Eng: Game faces on, this one is gonna be good. Sir, I am sorry in advance.  \n&gt;EW: You kidding? This shit is what makes watch worth-while.  \n\nWe sit back and put on our best 'I hate everything' faces and wait.\n\nNot fifteen minutes later, the door thuds open. In walks (with permission) the hero of this little story, a very low-ranking punk (LRP) who think's he's hot shit because he does maintenance on air planes instead of steam pipes. With him is his immediate supervisor (LPO) a gentleman of my rank, and their divisional officer (Divo) a wee young lieutenant. Divo is all fired up because how dare Engineering not fix his guy's problem, and he makes a bee-line for the engineering folk.\n\nThis path will, briefly, place him between EW and a panel that, by the order of people with a rank I could never hope to achieve in my life, the EW is not allowed to be obscured from. They HAVE to be able to see it, at all times. I wait until the merry little band is almost in front of the EW before I speak up.\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, please go around, the EW needs to be able to see that panel.  \n&gt;Divo: I will walk where I damn well-  \n\nHe stops. Because someone of approximately double his rank, four times his time-in-service and significantly crankier is staring him down. All of the fire leaves Divo in an instant. Which, honestly, is exactly what I wanted. When high-ranking people get fired up, it's usually for a good reason. When baby divos get fired up, everyone in their general vicinity is stupider for witnessing their temper tantrum. Baby divos get much more done when they're calm.\n\nLPO realizes that a Commander is sitting there and nearly poops himself. LRP is completely oblivious.\n\nThey walk back around our desks, not nearly as grudgingly as they could have, and take the slightly longer route to the engineering folk. Who are having the time of their lives, because this shit circus is well underway and they haven't had to even do anything yet.

Did he tell you what his complaint was?  \n\nLPO nearly cringes out of his skin. Because, no, obviously what happened is that LRP went and bitched at LPO that 'those assholes in engineering said they won't fix the broken showers' and LPO immediately went to his office to find some back-up and grabbed Divo. By the way we're all grinning at him, LPO knows he is in for the ass-reaming of his life.\n\nDivo, however, looks to LRP for an explanation. The little nematode puffs up, very pleased to have the floor, and an audience to boot. At least two Very Important Officers get to hear his sound reasoning for calling down to the tech line. I sit there wishing popcorn was allowed in DCC.\n\n&gt;LRP: Well, the hot water heater in the head can't keep up with the entire division when we all shower in the morning.  \n&gt;Eng: Does it put out hot water at all?  \n&gt;LRP: Well, yeah, when we all get up it works just fine. But as everyone takes their showers, it gets colder and colder.  \n&gt;Eng: Does it ever go completely cold?  \n&gt;LRP: No, but with a bigger heater, we could all take as long of showers as we wanted without it running out.  \n&gt;Water Control Guy: Showers should be limited to five minutes, you're wasting water.  \n&gt;LRP: Well, yeah, morning showers are pretty short, who wants to wake up early and shower? But when I take my second, longer shower in the evening, to relax after a long day of working-  \n\nSome teeny tiny sense of self-preservation kicks in and LRP shuts up and looks around. He is in a room full of people who play the 'food, shower, sleep - pick 2' game on a daily basis. Every single person in this room, including his back-up, is staring at him with either full derision or outright hostility.\n\nExcept Eng. She's still smiling her blank, polite, 'I have been in the retail trenches and am dead inside' smile. I may be in love.\n\n&gt;Eng: Sir, you can see why I denied his request. LPO, you may want to remind your guys that, despite being surrounded with water, there is a limit on how much fresh water we can make in a day and that long showers should be saved for in port. Was there anything else I can help you all with?  \n&gt;Divo: No, I think I've heard enough. You two, my office. *Now.*  \n\nThey leave. LPO looks close to tears or shoving LRP out a porthole. Divo is full of now-justified wrath. LRP still looks vaguely bemused as to why his excellent argument didn't sway us all to his side.\n\nThe door shuts. All of us immediately put our heads on our desk and cry with laughter. Someone hands Eng an IOU for drinks at the next port. \n\nEng's supervisor drafts an email to the ship's mid-tier leadership that not waking up early enough to get a hot shower is not a reason to request a new hot water heater and that water on board is limited. No details are provided and everyone eagerly looks forward to the rumor mill as people try and figure out what spawned *that* particular reminder.\n\nThe engines turn. The ship chugs on.\n\nEdit: Thanks to /u/RobAtSGH for the gold!", "author_fullname": "t2_wgvuw", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 4, "clicked": false, "title": "Buddy, you picked the wrong people to try and strong-arm.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "all long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_4v7jkk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7877, "total_awards_received": 5, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long r/ALL", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7877, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1469978431.0, "author_flair_css_class": "tftsflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 4}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1469810913.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings, all. This one is from way back when, about six years ago now, when I was in an entirely different career and halfway around the world. No salad dressing this time, and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re all disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a certain class of military warship, there is a place. The bridge may be in control of where the ship goes, but Damage Control Central is in charge of how fast it is getting there and whether or not it arrives in one piece. It&amp;#39;s run by a high-ranking officer from Reactor Department (EW) and his two cronies, one that monitors the ship&amp;#39;s water usage and one that monitors the ship&amp;#39;s electrical usage (hi) These three people can bring 97K+ tons of steel and sadness to a halt. Behind them are a small pile of engineering folk, literally the ship&amp;#39;s tech support branch. People could call DCC and report a problem (from an out light to a fire), and between all of us in there, we had the knowledge, skill, authority, and political clout to get a response team out. A lot of people didn&amp;#39;t know what kind of authority DCC held, or exactly who they were talking to when they called down. This made for some very entertaining conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One evening, the engineering folk get a call. One female sailor picks it up and naturally, we all listen in, because if it&amp;#39;s a fire or something, we all need to respond as rapidly as possible. From our POV, this is how the conversation goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eng: DCC, Eng speaking.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: The heater doesn&amp;#39;t work?&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Oh, yeah, that&amp;#39;s normal.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: No, we can&amp;#39;t turn it up.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: What? No, we can&amp;#39;t replace it, we&amp;#39;re in the middle of the Persian Gulf, where are we going to get another one?&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Look, it works fine. Take shorter showers.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Your division can put in a request for a bigger one when we get back to home port, but you&amp;#39;re not getting one now.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Yeah, no, I&amp;#39;m not ordering one. Replacing those things is beyond the scope of what we&amp;#39;re allowed to do underway.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Because policy.&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: Okay. You do that. We&amp;#39;ll be waiting. Make sure you request permission to enter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that, she hangs up. Naturally, we&amp;#39;re all staring. She grins at us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eng: Game faces on, this one is gonna be good. Sir, I am sorry in advance.&lt;br/&gt;\nEW: You kidding? This shit is what makes watch worth-while.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sit back and put on our best &amp;#39;I hate everything&amp;#39; faces and wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not fifteen minutes later, the door thuds open. In walks (with permission) the hero of this little story, a very low-ranking punk (LRP) who think&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s hot shit because he does maintenance on air planes instead of steam pipes. With him is his immediate supervisor (LPO) a gentleman of my rank, and their divisional officer (Divo) a wee young lieutenant. Divo is all fired up because how dare Engineering not fix his guy&amp;#39;s problem, and he makes a bee-line for the engineering folk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This path will, briefly, place him between EW and a panel that, by the order of people with a rank I could never hope to achieve in my life, the EW is not allowed to be obscured from. They HAVE to be able to see it, at all times. I wait until the merry little band is almost in front of the EW before I speak up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Sir, please go around, the EW needs to be able to see that panel.&lt;br/&gt;\nDivo: I will walk where I damn well-  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stops. Because someone of approximately double his rank, four times his time-in-service and significantly crankier is staring him down. All of the fire leaves Divo in an instant. Which, honestly, is exactly what I wanted. When high-ranking people get fired up, it&amp;#39;s usually for a good reason. When baby divos get fired up, everyone in their general vicinity is stupider for witnessing their temper tantrum. Baby divos get much more done when they&amp;#39;re calm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LPO realizes that a Commander is sitting there and nearly poops himself. LRP is completely oblivious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They walk back around our desks, not nearly as grudgingly as they could have, and take the slightly longer route to the engineering folk. Who are having the time of their lives, because this shit circus is well underway and they haven&amp;#39;t had to even do anything yet. Eng spins around, her hands on the arms of her chair, a very pleasant, blank smile on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Divo: Are you the one that won&amp;#39;t fix my guy&amp;#39;s showers?&lt;br/&gt;\nEng: The showers aren&amp;#39;t broken, sir. Did he tell you what his complaint was?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LPO nearly cringes out of his skin.

I work at an ISP as a tier 2 representative for tech support. Essentially, one of the jobs I have is programming calling features.\n\n\nThis call in particular happened about a month ago. A ticket had came to my queue about a customer having trouble accessing her voicemails. I dug deeper and found it was full as well. No problem, there were some programming errors, which I fixed and called the customer who will be known as Sweet Elderly Woman. (SEW)\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: *intro, verification* So, I am calling because you reported an issue with your voicemail today.\n\n\nSEW: Oh yes! Is it fixed?\n\n\nMe: Yes! It should be. I found that your box is full. It has *maximum amount* of messages in it.\n\n\nSEW: Dear, I'd hate to be a bother but could I get you to go in and delete them for me? (We have a way of accessing the messages if the customer cannot, doesn't want to, etc.) \n\n\nMe: Absolutely. I will gladly do this for you, SEW and I'll call you back when I'm finished?\n\n\nSEW: Yes please!\n\n\nShe thanks me and I hang up to go access the messages. Knowing full well that this is going to take at least 15 minutes, I go and read Wikipedia articles as the messages are playing. I eventually reach the last message and it catches my attention. I stopped reading, listened to it, began tearing up and saved it in her box. I compose myself before calling back.\n\n\nSEW: Hello?\n\n\nMe: Hi! It's /u/devdevo1919 again. I listened to all the messages and deleted them all except for one.\n\n\nSEW: Oh thank you, sweetheart! Why did you leave one?\n\n\nMe: SEW, I think you should listen to it. I will hang up to give you some time, okay?\n\n\nSEW: Okay, dear.\n\n\nI gave her time to listen to the message and called her back. She was crying when I called her back. It was then I learned the story. The message was from her husband who had passed away due to brain cancer 3 days after he left the message. It was him saying goodbye and that he loves SEW so much and he's \"never felt more alive\" all the years she spent with him. \n\n\n\nSEW was crying because he was deceased by the time she got to the hospital and had not heard his voice. She said I gave her part of herself back that she'd lost when he passed away. She thanked me and we disconnected the call.\n\n\nEDIT: To answer some of the comments I am seeing, no I do not have to listen to them but I explain crystal clear that the messages will start playing and I will hear who they're from. This person had the same last name as her which is why I listened to it and saved it.\n\n\nEDIT 2; Wow! Gold?!

(SEW)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;intro, verification&lt;/em&gt; So, I am calling because you reported an issue with your voicemail today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Oh yes! Is it fixed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yes! It should be. I found that your box is full. It has &lt;em&gt;maximum amount&lt;/em&gt; of messages in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Dear, I&amp;#39;d hate to be a bother but could I get you to go in and delete them for me? (We have a way of accessing the messages if the customer cannot, doesn&amp;#39;t want to, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Absolutely. I will gladly do this for you, SEW and I&amp;#39;ll call you back when I&amp;#39;m finished?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Yes please!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She thanks me and I hang up to go access the messages. Knowing full well that this is going to take at least 15 minutes, I go and read Wikipedia articles as the messages are playing. I eventually reach the last message and it catches my attention. I stopped reading, listened to it, began tearing up and saved it in her box. I compose myself before calling back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Hello?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Hi! It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"/u/devdevo1919\"&gt;/u/devdevo1919&lt;/a&gt; again. I listened to all the messages and deleted them all except for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Oh thank you, sweetheart! Why did you leave one?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: SEW, I think you should listen to it. I will hang up to give you some time, okay?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW: Okay, dear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave her time to listen to the message and called her back. She was crying when I called her back. It was then I learned the story. The message was from her husband who had passed away due to brain cancer 3 days after he left the message. It was him saying goodbye and that he loves SEW so much and he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;never felt more alive&amp;quot; all the years she spent with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SEW was crying because he was deceased by the time she got to the hospital and had not heard his voice. She said I gave her part of herself back that she&amp;#39;d lost when he passed away. She thanked me and we disconnected the call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: To answer some of the comments I am seeing, no I do not have to listen to them but I explain crystal clear that the messages will start playing and I will hear who they&amp;#39;re from. This person had the same last name as her which is why I listened to it and saved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2; Wow! Gold?! Thank you so much!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false,

I was cordial, told him no need to, etc. and didn't bring up her behavior when I was trying to help her.

True story.\n\nSo, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. You can imagine this was a very big company. We were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car.\n\n\nI usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. It was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights.\n\nThe phone rings.\n\n&gt; Yes hello, this the secretary of the CEO. We need you to come over NOW! We have a big problem.\n\n&gt; ME: What seems to be wrong?\n\n&gt; Her: Mr CEO is trying to open a file in Word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. I THINK WE ARE BEING HACKED! \n\n(this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower)\n\n&gt; Me: I'll take a look from here and take over your screen. Hang on.\n\nSo i take over his screen this is what happens:\nFile, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL*UUU**JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\n\n&gt; HER: I don't know what this is. You see?!? THis is so weird...\n\nNow, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. You don't just walk into the exec office every day.\n\n&gt; ME: Uhuh. I'll be there as soon as possible!\n\n\nSo i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. A very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. \n\nThey even had their own dining room and bar. THe security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and \n\nunderstood the importance.\nI get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked.\n&gt; Come over, have a look at this!

True story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, i was hired by a big defense company (upgrade tanks, naval weapons, etc) with over 3500 employees. You can imagine this was a very big company. We were in building 34 and if you needed to go somewhere quick you took a bike or an electric car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually did 2nd line support, but they had a couple of people call in sick and asked me to do first line support. It was a friday and not much was happening, besides the usual emailproblems and tech guys turning off unix machines that needed a checkdisk command with admin rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The phone rings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes hello, this the secretary of the CEO. We need you to come over NOW! We have a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME: What seems to be wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: Mr CEO is trying to open a file in Word, but everytime he does this, scrambled text is showing up. I THINK WE ARE BEING HACKED! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(this was a big issue, since a couple of weeks before this a group of activists broke into the company and climbed on top of our radar tower)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;ll take a look from here and take over your screen. Hang on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i take over his screen this is what happens:\nFile, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL&lt;em&gt;UUU&lt;/em&gt;*JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HER: I don&amp;#39;t know what this is. You see?!? THis is so weird...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, i knew what was wrong at this moment, but i wanted to see in person. You don&amp;#39;t just walk into the exec office every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ME: Uhuh. I&amp;#39;ll be there as soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i grab this electric car, drive over and 5 minutes later i walk into the executive building. A very nice building, totally different from the rest of the offices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even had their own dining room and bar. THe security guy sees me coming and waves me through, he was informed of my coming and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;understood the importance.\nI get out of the elevator at the top floor and am greeted by the secretary, a manager and some other assistent, all a bit panicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Come over, have a look at this! The ceo says..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shows me:\nFile, open: JKAHSFHJKHJHJJJJJJFJJJJJSAKKKALALLLALLALLALALLAL&lt;em&gt;UUU&lt;/em&gt;*JJJDKJKJASLKLKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i look at him.

Handled a few issues with users who had purchased their own machines because \u201cours were not fast enough,\u201d even though the ones they bought were supplied by us. But cest la vie. \n\nAt noon I walked into the conference room for the video review. $HIT was in there as well as the executive vice president of IT and technology. (yes I know) The conference started hilariously as the head of HR, or $HHR, could not get her video working. \n\nI walked her through how to fix that as it was a simple error. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?\n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Oh duh. Should have known it was something stupid like that. \n\nWe started the conference and HOOO BOOOY. She was gunning for me hard. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 So I have in front of me 19 complaints against you this year. Can you explain these?\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 That\u2019s it?\n\n&gt; $HHR - *Clearly not expecting that.* Uhh yes. How do you explain it?\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Well as you well know, each complaint is different and most do not have merit. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 So you are saying these complaints were made\u2026incorrectly?\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Yes that is exactly what I am saying. \n\nI pulled out the same folder she probably had. \n\n&gt; $Me \u2013 On Feb 12th *User* complained that I refused his request. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Good one to start with? Explain it. \n\n&gt; $ME - *user* wanted me to put a folder on his desktop that would allow him to transfer items between his local desktop and citrix. This is not possible unless he works on the domain\u2026which he does not. I offered him several alternative options but he refused each one. He only wanted the original option of a folder on his desktop. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 So this was impossible?\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Technology wise of course it is possible. We could have set him up with an FTP option to direct into his session. But that would never EVER get the approval. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Lets move on to the next one. *Different user* Claimed that you were rude to her on the phone and hung up on her. \n\n&gt; $me \u2013 Lets play the call log. \n\nThe call log is me being professional while she politely berates me on the phone\u2026until she cusses me out. I terminate the call and send it to HR. \n\n&gt; $Me \u2013 That call is the reason why SHE is fired. Your predecessor said I handled it well. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Ok lets move on to the lady who had to wait 4 extra days to get her laptop back from you.\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Name?\n\n&gt; $HHR - *lady who yelled in my face* said you helped her 3 days in a row and finally took an extra 4 days to get her laptop back to her. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 You mean the lady who yelled in my face and got fired because of it? Yeah I remember her. I had to go to the hospital that Friday so none of my work got done. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 I see the note here. You thought you had a hernia but it turned out to be a UTI?\n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Thanks for repeating it here\u2026 Yes. Anyways the point is her laptop was finished within 2 hours of me returning to work. The 4 days she is talking about is because we had a 3 day weekend.\n\nThe meeting went on like this for well over 30 minutes as we ran through each complaint with only 1 that was legitimate. I misread a technical error and had to fix it 30 minutes later. Oh well. Then came the real kicker. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Lets talk about the fire you started. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 I STARTED!?\n\n&gt; $HIT \u2013 HE STARTED!? (same time.)\n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 Wait what?\n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Per your report. The fuse box was overloaded when the third rack of servers plugged in and started a fire inside the wall that ended up burning out most of the building. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Yes that does sound correct. What your report failed to mention on the report, which I have in front of me because I FUCKING sent it. (Yes I did say that.) The circuit breaker was not an actual circuit breaker. It was a bypass installed to bring the building up to code. The fuse box had cabinets built over it so that the owner could hide it. When too much was plugged into a mains line, which was rated to handle it, the fuse should have blown. But there was about 50 cents worth of pennies shoved in there. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 How was this missed. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I am not an electrician, I am not a state building inspector, I am not omniscient, and I am certainly not omnipotent. I went in to set up an office. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 You appear to have an excuse for everything. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 Yes its called CYA. You literally have that on a poster in your office. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Now lets talk about your language to me yesterday. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 How about lets talk about your blatant disregard for the termination procedures you set in place. You created a paper snafu for my worker because you could not help yourself but to stick your nose where it does not belong. If you had followed procedure and not sent the termination paperwork through, he would have health insurance right now. Instead you decided to play tech and fired someone in the system. I spent 4 hours yesterday chasing paperwork and trying to keep this knowledge from him. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 I Do not appreciate your attitude. \n\n&gt; $ME \u2013 And I do not appreciate you taking actions on your own. You may be HR but even you are not allowed to terminate employees without\n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 OK That is far enough you have made your point $me. Remember that $HHR holds your job in her hand.\n\n&gt; $hit \u2013 Like a small bird.\n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 Thank you $hit. So you do need to show her some respect\u2026that being said. $HHR? He is right. You violated company policy, you tried to terminate an employee when it was not called for, and you created a mountain out of a single email. (Turning to me) Do you want to keep your job?\n\n&gt; $Me \u2013 Yes. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 Then never take a disrespectful tone or cuss at a member of the senior management again. I expect a written apology to her by the end of the day. No further action needs to be taken here. (Turning to the monitor that has $HHRs face on it) As for you. \n\n&gt; $HHR \u2013 Yes?\n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 You will apologize to both him and the employee you tried to terminate by the end of the day yourself. While he was disrespectful, cussed, and generally made an ass of himself, he is not wrong. You did overreact and wrongfully terminate a good worker forcing $ME here into overdrive trying to stop it in its tracks. You could have solved this by going to $ME when you first heard about it. I heard the call log and read everything about this incident. Simply put the end user was an idiot and needs to trust the people she calls to fix her computer. \n\nEVPIT stood up and gathered his things. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT \u2013 Hopefully this is the last I hear of any animosity towards upper management, or animosity coming from upper management. Good day people. \n\nEVPIT left and I went back to my desk apologizing for the attitude I took with the head of HR. At 4:55 PM the email came in from the head of HR apologizing for her role. I then had 5 minutes to explain to the tech what happened. He decided he owed me a lunch. \n\nI miss the Wahoo Lady.

He was one of those people who was known only by his first name.  Everyone knew exactly who you were talking about when you said you'd had to take a call from Vladimir.  \n\nThey tried to protect me, as the newbie, from Vladimir as long as possible, but one day when I'd been at the company for maybe six months it just couldn't be avoided.  No one else was available but me, and he was in a royal fury.  The operator called me up, apologized to me (even she knew who he was) and told me that she had no one else to take him.  I reluctantly agreed to take the call.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, this is the exchange the operator had with him immediately before she passed him to me.\n\n&gt; **Operator:** I'm going to pass you to Merkuri22.  She's new.\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** *(shouts)* I don't want somebody new!  I want somebody who knows something!\n\n&gt; **Operator:** *(shouts back)* She knows a lot, Vladimir!! *(slams down receiver, passing him to me)*\n\nVladimir's no Bob.  He's a fairly intelligent guy, but he gets frustrated super quick, and has a very hot temper.  I swear, sometimes when he calls us he doesn't want his issue to be fixed, he just wants to let us know the torture our product is putting him through.  He calls us to be a martyr on the line, and shout at us about how terrible the product is.  And my first call with him was one of those.\n\nLuckily, Operator was right.  I knew a lot.  I had picked up on our products super quick, and the issue he called me about was a piece of cake.  The hard part was getting him to shut up long enough to tell him the solution to his issue.  I managed to calm him down and fix his problem, and not long after that I had become his favorite tech.  It had very quickly gone from, \"I don't want to talk to her!!!\" to, \"Get me Merkuri22!  I need to speak to Merkuri22!  Nobody else can solve my problems, *nobody!!*\"\n\n***\n\nI learned to read his moods like a medium reading tea leaves.  Sometimes it was best to meet his fire with a the cool exterior of a nurse at a mental hospital explaining why we don't hit other patients, and other times I could only get his attention by spitting flames back in his face.\n\nOther techs could always tell when I was talking to Vladimir because they'd hear a one-sided conversation that went something like this:\n\n&gt; **Me:** Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* Vladimir. *Pause.* *VLADIMIR!!* *Pause.* You know I'm trying to help you, right?  Do you want me to get this working for you, or not?  *Pause.* Okay, then let me explain what's happening here...\n\n***\n\nMany times in my career I've compared what I do to the TV show House.  Tech support is a lot like diagnosing a patient.  I frequently tell my techs, \"Customers lie,\" (playing on House's \"Patients lie\") and every time I say it I'm thinking of Vladimir.  This is why I swear sometimes he'd call up just to try to prove to me that our product is crap, because he'd frequently lie to me about what did and didn't work.  He'd tell me whatever would mean he needed to be in a panicked state, up against a deadline that he could not possibly meet, all because our products suck.\n\nOne time he called me up with an issue where I knew exactly what it was.  I'd just solved it for another customer the day before.  We were on a remote meeting and I could see his screen.\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** I tried *everything* and *nothing* works!\n\n&gt; **Me:** Oh, I know what this is.  You need to do &lt;solution&gt;.\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** I *told* you!  I *tried* that and *it didn't work!*\n\n&gt; **Me:** *(thinks) That's impossible, it has to work when you do that.*\n\n&gt; **Me:** What exactly did you do?\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** I did &lt;exactly what I told him&gt; and *it didn't work!  Nothing works!  I told you!*\n\n&gt; **Me:** Can you do it again so I can see the steps you took?\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** *I TOLD YOU I DID &lt;solution&gt; AND IT DIDN'T WORK!*\n\n&gt; **Me:** Vladimir, calm down.  Can you do it one more time?  Do it for me?\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** *(calmer)* Fine.  I'll do it again for you.  See, I do this, and I click here, and I don't see-- oh, it's working this time!  You're the best!  I always know when I call you up that you'll fix it for me!\n\n***\n\nA few years later, Vladimir's favorite support grunt (me) was promoted to manager.  I was a working manager for a while, trying to manage my team and take calls at the same time, but that proved to not be very efficient, and after years of that I reduced the calls I directly took down to almost nothing.  Vladimir was *not* pleased.\n\nOne day he was having a hissy fit, and was demanding to speak to no one but me, even though he'd been told many times that I was now a manager and didn't take direct calls.  This particular day I was in and out of meetings about another customer who was legitimately having serious issues, and I couldn't make time for Vladimir.  There were times when the operator literally couldn't find me because I was bouncing between conference rooms and upper management offices.  \n\nAt one point the operator (now a different woman from earlier in this post) came and found me physically.  She was crying.  She told me about how upset Vladimir was, and how he was demanding to speak to me and wouldn't let her pass him to anyone else on the team, and she didn't know what to do.\n\nI was *livid*.  I still didn't have time to call him back because that other customer's issue was far from over and there were political ramifications I had to juggle, but I took a few minutes to write Vladimir a scathing email.  I told him that it was not the operator's fault that I wasn't available, shouting at her wouldn't make me come to the phone any faster, and that he was sabotaging his own attempts to get a solution by refusing to speak with the available qualified techs who were happy to help him with his issue.  I made sure he knew the operator's name, and that he'd made her cry.  Then I went back to trying to keep my other customer from hemorrhaging blood.\n\nNot long after I sent that email, the operator found me again, and told me that this had happened...\n\n&gt; **Operator:** Thank you for calling &lt;company&gt;, how may I direct your call?\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** Is this &lt;operator's name&gt;?\n\n&gt; **Operator:** *(recognizes his voice, tenses up)* Yes, it is.\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** This is Vladimir.  I just wanted to apologize.  I did not mean to yell at you.  That was completely unacceptable of me.\n\n&gt; **Operator:** Wow... t-thank you!  That means a lot to me.  *Pause.* Do you want to talk to tech support?\n\n&gt; **Vladimir:** No, thanks, I just called to apologize.  Have a nice day.  *Click.*\n\nThat was one of my proudest moments as a manager, making Vladimir call back just to apologize.\n\n***\n\nHe still calls us up every once in a while.  I haven't talked to him in years.  He's found another favorite, but every once and a while he still tells her about the way Merkuri22 used to do things, and tells her to go ask me for answers.  He still lies to her.  Sometimes she comes to me and says:\n\n&gt; **Tech:** Vladimir says the last time this happened you told him to do &lt;x&gt;.\n\n&gt; **Me:** I absolutely did not.\n\n&gt; **Tech:** I figured.\n\nAnd sometimes I still hear from someone else's cube...\n\n&gt; Vladimir...

Jack was a paid intern whose mother was friends with my boss's wife. Jack grew up in the wealthiest county in the state (where my Boss lives) and has had everything he ever wanted. A sense of entitlement that hung around him like the smell of five-day-old socks was the first thing I noticed upon being introduced to him as he went around the office.\n\n\"Jack, this is Clickity, our, erm...uh...tech...guy...\" My boss introduces me, in that way that old bosses who don't use computers often do.\n\nJack extends his hand. \"Oh, cool.

Adorable, I think.\n\n\"Eventually, yes. For the moment though, we have a shared email for interns on staff. I'll get you the credentials shortly.\" Most of the interns use the shared email for a while until getting their own. just standard procedure.\n\n\"You run the firewall, right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you can block and unblock sites?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Jack's eager smile is contagious.\n\n\"Cool! Nice to meet you.\" He waves and the Boss and Jack leave to go be introduced elsewhere.\n\nNow, dear reader, you might be wondering why I would call Jack the worst end user ever given his politeness and general smiling demeanor who has some understanding of what a sysadmin is, and what a sysadmin does. That's above average when it comes to end users.\n\nWell, we're only getting started here with Jack.\n\n--\n\nThe first thing jack did was complain the moment he was out of earshot. He apparently explained to the Boss that it really would be professional to have his own email given his experience and the fact that he was really more than just an intern. See, Jack knew his shit and that was that if he complained to Mother, she would complain to Boss-Wife, who would complain to Boss. And Boss, figuring an email is a small thing to ask for, had a request to set up a personalized email account for Jack on my desk within the hour.\n\nThis was not to be a good start of a relationship with one's IT Guy.\n\n--\n\nDay 2, I got an IT ticket for the room where the interns work. it's a large open office with a bunch of computers and printers where the interns print stuff all day long. Because it's such mind-numbing work, they tend to play music off of Pandora or Spotify in there. The ticket says:\n\n\"From INTERNEMAIL@companyemail: Hey, we're having issues with spotify. Not super important, but please help if you're free! thanks\"\n\nAw, those guys are always nice to me. Maybe it's because I leave reddit unblocked on our firewall so they can reddit at lunch.\n\nAn hour or so later I have a few free minutes and I head down. I check out spotify and find the issue and fix it. Jack is there and watches closely.\n\n\"We can use Spotify here?\" he asks.\n\n\"Yep,\" I reply.\n\n\"Pandora works, too,\" another intern adds. Everything checks out and I leave the happy-again-they-can-play-music interns and Jack.\n\n--\n\nA couple hours later, I got a note on my desk. See, Boss knew I allowed people to play music and such at the office. He believed was that Spotify is a HUGE security risk, leaving holes in our firewall through which everything from viruses to malware to cyberterrorists could come through. Boss was unhappy that I would allow such a threat to exist in our system, and ordered me to close it up.\n\nI called Boss. When I asked who told him these incorrect things about Spotify? Oh, Jack did, of course.\n\nI explained that Spotify was not a threat, and that Jack was simply mistaken. Jack, however, was on the other end of the line, in Boss's office, on speakerphone, and interjected: \"Dude, it's alright if you didn't know about the security issue. But don't try and make me look bad for your mistake.\"\n\nI'm stunned as Boss hangs up the phone after demanding I fix it.\n\n**Edit:** clarity", "author_fullname": "t2_g4goc", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Jack, the Worst End User, Part 1.", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "medium", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_2bb3ki", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7240, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "5e850644-551c-11e1-a56f-12313d096aae", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "M", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7240, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1406211164.0, "author_flair_css_class": "tftsflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1405960945.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1 &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2be9fw/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_2/\"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2bhoz1/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_3/\"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2blg90/jack_the_worst_end_user_part_4/\"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been working as a small office&amp;#39;s sysadmin for a little over two months when Jack was hired.

If it goes wrong, you\u2019ll be there all weekend fixing it.\n\nSo, in the spirit of being careful, friday afternoon drinks were a tradition.  4pm Friday was beer o\u2019clock, and as the resident only-person-not-excited-by-Crown-Lager, responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me.  No big deal right?  Except that this was the day that I finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically.  I wasn\u2019t going to waste it.  \n\nI did not waste it.  Our small 10-person company got rip-roaringly drunk.  Like \u2018arrested for being outside in this state\u2019 drunk.  There was Jack Daniels cans stacked to the ceiling.  Chips had fallen liberally to the floor.  Someone couldn\u2019t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet, under \u2018C\u2019, for chicken.  It was one of /those/ drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess.  Around 9pm, after five solid hours of Aus-Spec partying, we broke off and headed into the night.  I wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour, downed another jug of beer, and smiled to myself that the week had ended.  \n\nFate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.  \n\nMy phone buzzed in my pocket.  I ran outside, tripping up the stairs as I went, managed to steady myself against a signpost, and answered.  It was the CEO.  The primary and secondary route servers were down.  I stood frozen in time for an instant, the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car, and then asked him to repeat himself.  \n\n&gt; CEO: YES BOTH THE ROUTE SERVERS ARE DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  \n\nI cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had.  They, in and of themselves, were the primary thing around which our business existed, and all other things were secondary to them.  My state was by far the biggest, with some of the biggest ISPs and content providers in the country attached.  And this was the first full network outage we\u2019d ever had.  And it was my problem.  And I\u2019d consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant.  \n\nI yelled .. something, and ran off in the direction of work.  It was only when I bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that I started to realise how drunk I was.  When the elevator arrived at my floor, and I bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door, I knew I was in trouble.  That hallway was only 20 feet long.  But it didn\u2019t matter.  My wallet hit the card reader.  I\u2019d made it.  \n\nHabit\u2019s a funny thing.  You get so used to the noises, clicks, beeps and responses that you realise something\u2019s wrong in an instant.  \n\nThere was no response from the card reader.  An error, surely?  Interference, something new in my wallet?  I dug the card out, throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own.  Nothing.  Not an \u2018Access Denied\u2019 six beeps, or a \u2018Card Format Unrecognised\u2019 five beeps.  Nothing.  The lights were on, but no-one was home.  A few feet away, the keypad for the alarm was lit up like a headlight convention.  All the lights were on, the screen totally blacked out.  No beeps for keypresses.  Just .. nothing.  \n\nThe blood drained from my face.  The route servers were inside, suffering some unknown fate, our customers probably getting more furious by the minute, and I /could not open the door/.  AGAIN.  No, sod it.  I wasn\u2019t taking any more of this security system\u2019s crap.  I was getting into this datacentre, security system be damned.  \n\nYou all know what I\u2019d tried before, and I knew as well, so I didn\u2019t bother trying again.  My tools, once again, were behind the locked door, and then the light went on over my head.  \n\n&gt; Chhopsky: I can\u2019t .. go through the door \u2026 I can\u2019t .. go AROUND the door .. I can\u2019t go .. UNDER it \u2026. but can I go OVER it!?  \n\nThis is the logic of a drunk engineer; try all the dimensions!  There was a chair that we left outside for people working outside the DC, so in my infinite wisdom, I dragged the chair over to the wall, and lifted a ceiling tile.  Unlike the DC, where the ceiling tiles were weighed down with hundreds of heavy cables, the office was free and clear.  And the wall itself stopped at the ceiling.  So, pushing the tile into the cavity between the suspended ceiling and the concrete, I hoisted myself up into the ceiling.  \n\nThis did not work as well as I\u2019d hoped because I was not very strong.  I kicked and pushed off the wall, scrambling to push myself up onto what I now realised was a very thin wall.  For those not familiar with a suspended ceiling, metal rods are drilled into the concrete block above, and a grid pattern hangs below it.  Inside those grids are weak, light tiles basically made of a combination of cardboard and plaster.  Looking at the predicament I\u2019d gotten myself into, it became apparent that the only things that were going to support my weight up here were the tie-rods into the concrete.  So I\u2019d hold onto the rods with my hands, and lying prone in the ceiling, distribute the rest of my weight along the horizontal connectors. I\u2019d drop down onto the file cabinet at the far end of the room, about 15 feet away.  This plan was /flawless/.  \n\nAnd it worked.  For about 6 of the required 15 feet, upon which point my hands slipped, and I fell through the centre of the ceiling tile, towards the floor below.  By some insane miracle, I landed mostly on my feet, scrambling ungracefully to regain balance, coughing up ceiling tile dust and god knows what else.  Probably asbestos.  \n\nWhen the coughing stopped, I ran over to the security panel, pulled the power, and plugged it back in.  It beeped a single happy POST beep and hummed to life, making normal sounds instead of the endless buzzing it had been making before.  My access restored, I quickly found the problem - a circuit breaker had tripped, and due to a wiring error on the part of an electrician at some point, both route servers had been wired into the same circuit, rather than the different feeds on different UPS\u2019s via different distribution boards that they were supposed to.  \n\nWith a dustpan and brush, I set about cleaning up the nightmare my dramatic entrance had caused.  It was not a small mess - ceiling tiles are about 5 feet by 2 feet, and this one had exploded.  It took about an hour.  After finally sweeping up all the mess, putting the ceiling tile I\u2019d broken to get up there back together, and replacing the one I\u2019d broken getting down, I walked my ass out the door, feeling smug that no-one would be the wiser for my ceiling entrance, and I\u2019d have a grand story to tell.  \n\nMonday morning rolled around and I was the last one in.  Aaron stared at me.  \n\n&gt; Aaron: What the hell did you do to my desk?  \n&gt; Chhopsky: ... wha?\n\nI walked into the office, and stared in horror.  I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019d cleaned up but it looked someone had hit a bag of flour with a baseball bat.  It was /everywhere/.  How wasted was I?  What did I spend an hour cleaning?  And how in almighty crap did I diagnose an electrical circuit being miswired and split with no electrician tools of any kind?  \n\nI have no idea.\n\nBut what I did know, was how to break in. So I documented the procedure, and added it to the Tech Support Wiki.", "author_fullname": "t2_4era9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 4, "clicked": false, "title": "\"THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES\"", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_2coi5n", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7121, "total_awards_received": 7, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7121, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1407241222.0, "author_flair_css_class": "tftsflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_1": 2, "gid_2": 4}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1407239236.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t do any work on Friday in IT.  If it goes wrong, you\u2019ll be there all weekend fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of being careful, friday afternoon drinks were a tradition.  4pm Friday was beer o\u2019clock, and as the resident only-person-not-excited-by-Crown-Lager, responsibility for arranging the drinks fell to me.  No big deal right?  Except that this was the day that I finally got an unlimited account with the local liquor store that would be billed to the company automatically.  I wasn\u2019t going to waste it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not waste it.  Our small 10-person company got rip-roaringly drunk.  Like \u2018arrested for being outside in this state\u2019 drunk.  There was Jack Daniels cans stacked to the ceiling.  Chips had fallen liberally to the floor.  Someone couldn\u2019t find a bin and filed a chicken wing in the file cabinet, under \u2018C\u2019, for chicken.  It was one of /those/ drinking sessions where everyone is just a total mess.  Around 9pm, after five solid hours of Aus-Spec partying, we broke off and headed into the night.  I wandered down to a nearby bar and watched some bands play for an hour, downed another jug of beer, and smiled to myself that the week had ended.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My phone buzzed in my pocket.  I ran outside, tripping up the stairs as I went, managed to steady myself against a signpost, and answered.  It was the CEO.  The primary and secondary route servers were down.  I stood frozen in time for an instant, the same way a deer looks at the headlights of an oncoming car, and then asked him to repeat himself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CEO: YES BOTH THE ROUTE SERVERS ARE DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE IS OFFLINE GET IN THERE NOW FIX IT DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress enough that these two servers were the most important thing our company had.  They, in and of themselves, were the primary thing around which our business existed, and all other things were secondary to them.  My state was by far the biggest, with some of the biggest ISPs and content providers in the country attached.  And this was the first full network outage we\u2019d ever had.  And it was my problem.  And I\u2019d consumed enough alcohol that my blood could have been used as a fire accelerant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I yelled .. something, and ran off in the direction of work.  It was only when I bumped into the glass front doors before they opened that I started to realise how drunk I was.  When the elevator arrived at my floor, and I bumped into both sides of the hallway before making it to the door, I knew I was in trouble.  That hallway was only 20 feet long.  But it didn\u2019t matter.  My wallet hit the card reader.  I\u2019d made it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Habit\u2019s a funny thing.  You get so used to the noises, clicks, beeps and responses that you realise something\u2019s wrong in an instant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no response from the card reader.  An error, surely?  Interference, something new in my wallet?  I dug the card out, throwing my wallet on the ground and badged it on its own.  Nothing.  Not an \u2018Access Denied\u2019 six beeps, or a \u2018Card Format Unrecognised\u2019 five beeps.  Nothing.  The lights were on, but no-one was home.

I was working in the corporate headquarters of a very large telco, responsible for the email system for HQ - about 1100 users at the time. Like all the sysadmins at HQ, I was a contractor, working through a bodyshop outsourcer. \n\nMy boss was a guy I'll call S. S was the site manager for the outsourcer, and was the direct manager of all the contractor sysadmins.    \n\nThe customer contact was a guy I'll call J.   J was what they called an IT planner - basically a systems architect. He had dotted-line responsibility over all the sysadmins, including me.  \n\nI also had a backup there, who I'll call B. B was a competent sysadmin, capable of handling most day to day stuff. \n\nWe normally kept staff in the office from 8-6 on workdays, with an on-call rotation for certain specialty areas, including email.  Back then, we carried a pager (yes, an old school beeper) for oncall duty.   My oncall rotation was one week on, one week off.   This story happened in my \"off\" week, when B carried the pager.    \n\nOne saturday night, at around 3:30am, my home phone rang. My wife answered, and it was J calling.  She grumpily handed the phone to me.  Now my wife and I had just gotten home, having been out for much of the night with our neighbors. I was, for lack of a more refined term, positively hammered at this point.   \n\nJ informed me that there was an email outage, and that I needed to remote in and get it back up immediately, and then drive to the office to start a root cause analysis.  I informed him that I was in no condition to drive (let alone touch a production rig) and asked what B told him when he called the on-call pager.  J told me that he didn't call the oncall pager because this was way too serious of a problem to trust the backup sysadmin.  He wanted me working on this, and that if I can't be relied upon to do my job when I was needed, he'd find someone else who could, and hung up the phone.   I went back to sleep. \n\nThe next morning I had an email from B, telling me that J had called him at home (rather than paging the oncall rotation.) It was a very simple issue - our backup software went screwy and started writing out hundreds of GB of temp files, which filled up a critical volume on our production email server.  Temp files deleted, email services restarted, problem kicked over to our backup software SME to figure out what happened.  Total downtime after B got the call was about 15 minutes.  \n\nThe next day, I arrived at the office to a note from S, my manager, asking me to come see him ASAP.  I went to S' office, and sitting there was J, who was in the process of demanding that I be fired immediately for \"being drunk at work.\"  From there, the conversation went something like this: \n\n&gt;S: But Blempglorf wasn't at work.  He was at home, and wasn't in the on-call rotation this weekend.  \n&gt;J: I don't want to hear it about the on-call rotation.  Blempglorf needs to be ready to work when I tell him to. I can't rely on an alcoholic, and I want him gone.  \n&gt;S: If he's not on call, he's free to do whatever he wants with his time.\n&gt;J: Not as long as he works for me.   \n\nJ then demands that I hand my office badge to him, and calls security from S' phone to have me escorted out of the building.  I'm in absolute disbelief at this point.  S gets up and goes off to points unknown, just as security arrives to see me out to the parking lot.  As I'm driving off, I see J's boss, I'll call her M.  M is running across the street to the parking lot.  Strange, but I was more focused on how the hell I was going to explain this to my wife when I got home. \n\nI got home, and my wife was sitting on the couch, just absolutely livid. Now this was REALLY weird, because I hadn't told her what happened yet. \"Those motherfuckers fired you!?!?!\"   I'm confused as hell at this point.  My wife told me that M called her, and that I need to call her back as soon as possible.  Come to find out, when S had went off, he was going to M's office to explain the situation and keep him from shitcanning me.  M heard from S, and freaked the hell out.  When I saw her running across the street, she was trying to catch me in the parking lot before I left to tell me to come back in.  When M couldn't find my car, she went back into the office and called the house, intending to leave me a voicemail, but got my wife instead.  M told my wife what had happened, promised to rein J in, and asked her to tell me to come back into the office to sort it out. \n\nSo I let them stew for a while.  M called about 20 minutes after I got home.   We let her go to the machine.  S called as well, just as my wife and I went out to get some lunch.  Over lunch, my wife and I talked about how we would handle this, and (largely for financial reasons) we decided to talk to them to see if we could work this out. We got back home to 3 more voicemails from M and S. About 30 seconds after we walked in the door, the phone rang again. This time it was J, obviously on speakerphone.  J apologized to me, and asked me to come back to work the next day. I agreed, but as he hung up, I could hear M say to him: \n\n&gt;\"J, you're a fucking idiot.\" \n\nI worked there for another year after that, before another J fuckup made me leave once and for all.  That was a whole 'nother story. \n\nEdit: [Here's the whole 'nother story!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/621lif/how_i_quit_after_i_got_fired_and_unfired/)\n\nEdit 2: Gold?

I was instructed to reduce spending in IT by X amount before the end of the year. The company as a whole need to cut 3m in spending by end of fiscal year because reasons. \n\nI was specifically handed a list of \"potentials\" as a recommendation to cut. \n\nFirst thing I did was collected all of those people and gave them 2 lists. The number of phone line accounts vs the number of employees, and the number of fax accounts that are inactive. \n\nFor 2 weeks those men and women worked hard. They scoured AD, the horrible phone website, and verifying the fax accounts. \n\nThey found over 12k phone accounts, that cost 22.95 each, that belong to termed users but are still active. \n\nWe did the audit on the fax system by determining who has not received or sent a fax in 6 months. We found over 37k accounts incactive. OF those 9k had never logged in, 12k were termed users and nearly everyone else had set up their efax and never used it. The rest were people who rarely faxed as a backup. They wanted their accounts to stay. \n\nSo 35.5k accounts at 19.50 each a month we were spending. \n\nSo far we were at a little under 1m a month being spend on useless things. \n\nI started to go through Vendor programs A-G looking for similar instances. These included programs like snipping tool like program, password manager, a couple of CRM programs, and a stock program that a couple hundred employees literally never used. \n\nAfter that was done, I worked with the server dudes for 2 days getting these accounts directly associated with our AD accounts. Every single user now has creds associated with AD. \n\nNow when a user is listed as term for 7 days, it terminates said accounts at the end of current billing cycle. \n\nAs a side effect, I just accidentally an SSO. \n\nAll in all I saved the company over 2m a month.\n\nToday came with the promise of an all corp supervisor meeting and the BS that that entails. \n\nIt would take too much time to list out which department is with whos character so all lines will begin with &gt; $Sales or &gt; $HR. \n\n&gt; $CEO - I am very glad all of you are here. As you know end of fiscal year is approaching and we must trim the fat, so to speak, for year end financials and the IRS. \n\nHE goes on like this for 20 minutes and then has everyone go around the table. We arent supposed to say things like. \"We terminated X number of users.\" But instead say things like. \"We reduced salary cost by X percent.\"\n\n&gt; $Accounting - Our department was able to reduce financial responsibility, in particular salary, by 12 percent saving the company 80k a year. \n\n&gt; $CEO - OK very good. Marketing?\n\n&gt; $Marketing - We reduced financial responsibility but 45 percent. However only one percent of that was salary. The rest was from programs we had used in the past but had stopped using. We were still paying for them though. \n\n&gt; $ME - Which programs were those so I can mark them down?\n\n&gt; $Marketing. - *Windows GFX Programs they stopped using when they switch to mac.* Plus a stock program from when *former head of marketing* Ran the place. \n\nShe mentioned the stock program I had removed. The one we were paying for in IT. Not marketing. I let it slide. \n\n&gt; $ME - If anyone else has terminated a program let me know please and I will take care of anything that needs to be taken care of on my end. \n\nTwo more department tried to claim credit for my auditing work. When it finally came to my time though. \n\n&gt; $CEO - Well we are just about out of time IT I am sorry bu...\n\n&gt; $ME - $CEO I am sorry to interrupt but there is information in my report which is not only vital to this meeting, but will have major implications on everyone in this room and the company. \n\n&gt; $CEO - Ok. Proceed. \n\n&gt; $ME - As supervisor over the IT support area I have increased the salary responsibility by 20 percent as a way to save money. \n\n&gt; $HR - Come again?\n\n&gt; $ME - Using the list of suggested layoffs from HR, I gathered those exact people for a team to audit all cost incurring systems that are utilized by *our company* IT. \n\n&gt; $Accounting - How does more employees save \n\n&gt; $ME - *interrupting him* Using this audit, we have determined that there are over 100k accounts belonging to various programs, services, and paid software. These accounts either belonged to termed employees, people who did not even know they had the account, people who did not use the accounts ever, or people who simply changed computer systems. \n\n&gt; In fact *Vendor system* A, B, and C were not being paid for by Marketing, Accounting, and Sales respectively. Those costs were incurred by IT. (I hand out the leaflets showing the money came form IT budget. \n\n&gt; $CIO - So what does all of this mean. \n\n&gt; $ME - We have tied every single vendor account, cost incurring service, and basically every single system that we pay per employee to that employee's AD account. This effectively creates an SSO for our users.  ON top of that it creates the immediate savings of 2.3 million with accounts terminated for terminated users, accounts terminated that were literally never used, and account terminated for programs discarded. \n\n&gt; $CEO - *Whistles.* 2.3 million. That is what I like to hear. \n\n&gt; $ME - A month. \n\nYes I dramatically revealed that 2.3 million was not annual, it was monthly. \n\n&gt; $CEO - So let me get this straight. We all here as a company have been wasting 24m a year on things no one used, terminated employees, and discarded programs?\n\n&gt; $ME - Yes. However with the addition of tying all accounts to the  AD credentials, we have effectively stopped this from happening in the future. \n\n&gt; $CIO - Why was this allowed to happen?\n\n&gt; $ME - Your predecessor created this storm and we, as a company, inherited it. I never had the urge to look into these issues as they are not directly IT related issues. I just refuse to fire my guys for no reason other than to save money. No IT employees are lost in this. In fact we gained 2. These two are part of a team in charge of all vendor accounts. They will approve, deny, create, change, and manage all vendor accounts. \n\n&gt; $HR - What will this team be called. \n\n&gt; $ME - Umm Vendor Accounts?\n\n&gt; $CEO - I am still hung up on these accounts. How is it that they were allowed to accumulate like that?\n\n&gt; $ME - The Former CIO set up these accounts for other departments but set the cost to go to IT. No one looked into it for IT because why would we? These are not IT programs. They are *our company* programs. IF you want to blame someone, blame the former CIO. No one in the room knew some of these accounts existed until I had the urge to look them up. \n\nLong pause. \n\n&gt; $Me - Look at it this way.

Now, I work in a company that services critical process equipment in a country with a distinct west half and east half, separated by the sea (important as we are based in the western half). The Client was a major refining plant for the petroleum industry.\n\nAs we normally do, we go through the usual troubleshooting steps - did you this turn on, is this connection active,  yadaa yadaa but the only only answer coming from $user was \"yes yes yes\" with nothing seemingly wrong. This went on for about half an hour when suddenly our boss comes in. The Client's  Head of Production ($head) had just called him and was apparently livid. It turns out the machine had stopped working for more than an hour, and the production was severely interrupted until the problem got fixed.\n\nNow everyone was in panic, as every hour the production was interrupted, the Client was losing money in the tens of thousands (US$) and the Client had the right to sue us for any damages that occur as a result of equipment downtime. $head was not happy that the their internal team was not able to fix problem, and $user was not making any headway in fixing the problem via phone.\n\nTo resolve the issue, $head demanded that support be performed immediately onsite. Coming back to my earlier points - 1. It's the festive season 2. they are across the sea, traveling was a bit of a problem but $head said money was not an issue and they would pay anything for immediate onsite support.\n\nCue $M my mentor who was handed the unsavory task of handling the emergency. Immediately he grabbed his tools, and sped off to the airport to grab the next available flight. At the same time, his wife had to pack some clothes for him from home and rushed to pass it to him at the airport. Due to the festive season, $M didn't have choices for flights so in the end he had to take a US$1000 business class flight (normally flights to where the Client is located costs \\~US$80, we're a developing country, so yeah).\n\nUpon arriving, $M was whisked from the airport with a driver, sent immediately to the refinery and granted immediate security clearance to enter plant (anyone working in petroleum would know how big a deal this is). By this time, a good 6 hours or so had passed since we received the call and well into the night. Greeting him in front of the equipment was $head, $user and various other senior managements personnel all anxious to see what the problem is.\n\n$M is a guy with no chill, and he was also the one originally speaking to $user on the phone. He recounts this part so I'm paraphrasing him:-\n\n&gt;$head: So what is it the problem?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: Wait, let me take a look (starts to go through the normal troubleshooting checklists, but stops almost immediately)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: $user are you sure you checked everything I asked you to?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$user: Yes! Everything, word for word!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: Are you absolutely sure?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$user: Yes!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: Do you remember what was the third thing i asked you check over the phone?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$user: Why does it matter? just fix the g\\*\\*\\*\\*mn problem!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: The first thing we normally check is to make sure the PC is turned on (points at the CPU LED indicator)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: The second thing we check is to make sure the equipment is on (points to the machine LED),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: The third thing (he brings his hand to a gas control valve, rotates it, and a loud hiss is heard as the gas line pressurizes, and the equipment beeps) is to make sure the gas is on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$user:....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$head:....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$everyone else in the room:....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$M: I would like to go have dinner now\n\nAfter more awkward silence, $head thanks $M for his effort and asks the driver to bring $M somewhere for dinner.\n\nYou'd think the story ends here, but there's more!\n\nBy the time $M finished his dinner, it was well past midnight so he checked himself into a hotel for the night. The next day he went back to the airport and found out that all flights were completely sold out for the next 4 days due to the festive traveling. He called my boss to inform him that he was basically stranded, and my boss just coolly said to him \"Well $M, consider this as having a free holiday paid by the Client\"\n\nSo $M checks into the most luxurious hotel in the area, spends the next 4 days basically on vacation before coming back to work.\n\nIn total we billed the client for \\~US$10,000 for the flights, hotel, emergency arrangements, allowances etc. all for 10 seconds to turn check LEDs and turn a valve. This is not including the losses from halting the production. It's still one of our most memorable stories that we recount to new hires or clients in our industry. Sometimes we wonder what happened to $user but he was transferred out if his role not too long after this incident.\n\n**TLDR : Client pays US$10,000 for a super easy job that could be done themselves, and my mentor gets a free holiday**\n\nEdit 1: Wow, 4k votes!

Everything, word for word!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: Are you absolutely sure?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$user: Yes!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: Do you remember what was the third thing i asked you check over the phone?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$user: Why does it matter? just fix the g****mn problem!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: The first thing we normally check is to make sure the PC is turned on (points at the CPU LED indicator)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: The second thing we check is to make sure the equipment is on (points to the machine LED),  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: The third thing (he brings his hand to a gas control valve, rotates it, and a loud hiss is heard as the gas line pressurizes, and the equipment beeps) is to make sure the gas is on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$user:....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$head:....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$everyone else in the room:....  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$M: I would like to go have dinner now&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After more awkward silence, $head thanks $M for his effort and asks the driver to bring $M somewhere for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d think the story ends here, but there&amp;#39;s more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time $M finished his dinner, it was well past midnight so he checked himself into a hotel for the night. The next day he went back to the airport and found out that all flights were completely sold out for the next 4 days due to the festive traveling. He called my boss to inform him that he was basically stranded, and my boss just coolly said to him &amp;quot;Well $M, consider this as having a free holiday paid by the Client&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So $M checks into the most luxurious hotel in the area, spends the next 4 days basically on vacation before coming back to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In total we billed the client for ~US$10,000 for the flights, hotel, emergency arrangements, allowances etc. all for 10 seconds to turn check LEDs and turn a valve. This is not including the losses from halting the production. It&amp;#39;s still one of our most memorable stories that we recount to new hires or clients in our industry. Sometimes we wonder what happened to $user but he was transferred out if his role not too long after this incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR : Client pays US$10,000 for a super easy job that could be done themselves, and my mentor gets a free holiday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: Wow, 4k votes! Totally wasn&amp;#39;t expecting such a response, thanks for the support everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 6, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Silver", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png"}, {"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c670b7d7bc99c03bffde92706ad5ceeda12658f3", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63a498673bd4a518a031783179a767cc4135d5f5", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e8802df47965bd66370b72ac3cb7639e9eae92ae", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc40ae1c1a18193f190da70a2748d0a48c17a5a9", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77ba4d8e862ca183dd8c09e002fd123a6b2f52f5", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

LTL;FTP.\n\n\nLike most of you here, I too have parents whom are largely tech-illiterate. but over the last two years, I've been making a conscious effort to get my parents (especially mum) to understand computers better. \n\n\nI'm a big believer of the ol' *give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day, teach him how to fish, and he can have food for life* mentality. So rather than showing mum how to resolve her every problem, we go through a process of:\n\n\n* *what do you think is wrong?* \n* and *how are you going to solve it?*\n\n\n\nNow admittedly, things do get incredibly frustrating in this process, and it can often take ~1/2 hour up to 1 hour to resolve issues. **BUT**, it has slowly been working.\n\n\n\nSo today, mum came to me with a problem, and as usual, seemed to blow it way out of proportion.\n\n\n\n&gt; $mum: My phone is broken.\n\n&gt; $me: What do you mean?\n\n&gt; $mum: The camera doesn't work.\n\n&gt; $me: What do you mean exactly?\n\n&gt; $mum: When I go to the camera app, it says *connection cannot be establised*\n\n&gt; $me: So have you tried anything to resolve it? (*insert smirky face*)\n\n&gt; $mum: I turned it off and on again. But that didn't work.. \n\n&gt; $me: uh huh.\n\n&gt; $mum: So then I booted the phone into recovery mode. \n\n&gt; $me: (*cue disbelief*)\n\n&gt; $mum: And then I wiped the cache partition.\n\n&gt; $me: (*sustained disbelief*)\n\n&gt; $mum: But when I rebooted the phone, it still didn't work.

So rather than showing mum how to resolve her every problem, we go through a process of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;what do you think is wrong?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and &lt;em&gt;how are you going to solve it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now admittedly, things do get incredibly frustrating in this process, and it can often take ~1/2 hour up to 1 hour to resolve issues. &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt;, it has slowly been working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So today, mum came to me with a problem, and as usual, seemed to blow it way out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: My phone is broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: What do you mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: The camera doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: What do you mean exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: When I go to the camera app, it says &lt;em&gt;connection cannot be establised&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: So have you tried anything to resolve it? (&lt;em&gt;insert smirky face&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: I turned it off and on again. But that didn&amp;#39;t work.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: uh huh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: So then I booted the phone into recovery mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: (&lt;em&gt;cue disbelief&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: And then I wiped the cache partition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me: (&lt;em&gt;sustained disbelief&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$mum: But when I rebooted the phone, it still didn&amp;#39;t work.

The work was quite nice, I was doing helpdesk stuff but also things with servers and was involved in SAP deployment. Anyway - support of users was one my tasks.\nCompany was from automotive sector - airbags/seatbelts etc. and I was working in production plant connected with offices so I had to support both facilities.\nOne time I get a call - that was unusual, as we always reminded users to write tickets, which were responded in real-time so it took max. 10 minutes before I contacted incident submitter. \nCall was more or less like:\n\n\n- \"For f**** sake what are you doing with the scanners, whole line has stopped and we are completely blocked now, we can't do anything without them, they're not working and showing errors, &lt;here just put some more f-words from 50 year old lady, production leader, who looked a lot like Shrek after a car accident&gt;\"\nThe line was about 10 min. walk from my office so I stayed on the phone while I was walking there.\n- \"Ok, tell me what is going on, calm down.\"\n- \"YOU ARE MESSING WITH THE SYSTEMS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED GOD DAMMIT, I AM WRITING TO YOUR MANAGER AS SOON AS IT WILL BE FIXED\"\n- \"Please calm down, we were not doing anything with this since January (it was August).\"\n- \"YEAH SURE, YOU NEVER ADMIT TO  A F$%@-UP\"\n\n\nAt this point I was already thinking about different ways of cutting her throat open, but still played it cool. \nI finally arrive at the line and ask her to hand me a scanner. All people from production line were standing there with crossed shoulders and looked at me like \"Here you go, you messed up so fix it huh\" and the leader said something like \"Oh here you are, now make it work after you f***ed up\".\n\n\nBasically, the scanner was just something like a Windows PDA with scanning module.\nNothing fancy. All she had to do was to power it up, type username/password and it was ready to go, it was all about scanning the bar codes of airbag parts.\n\n\nSo I take the scanner and look at the screen.\nBack at her.\nBack at the screen.\n\n\n- \"Were you asked to change password recently?\"\n- \"YES, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR SUCH BULLS**T\"\n- \"Because the screen says that you have typed wrong password 5 times and you are always reminded that after this the scanner blocks for 20 minutes. And by the way you have 3 backup scanners so why you didn't use them? You messed up, not me. And it's not ok to talk like that to any employee of the company, so I will surely report it to YOUR manager - we have call recording enabled on our mobiles (we didn't, but she could never know).\"\n- \"Ugh... ummm, emmm.\"\n- \"Yea, bye.\"\n\nI told the story to her manager, she apologized officially the whole IT team, brought some cheapest cookies from the store and basically pretended to be sorry.

Anyway - support of users was one my tasks.\nCompany was from automotive sector - airbags/seatbelts etc. and I was working in production plant connected with offices so I had to support both facilities.\nOne time I get a call - that was unusual, as we always reminded users to write tickets, which were responded in real-time so it took max. 10 minutes before I contacted incident submitter. \nCall was more or less like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;For f**** sake what are you doing with the scanners, whole line has stopped and we are completely blocked now, we can&amp;#39;t do anything without them, they&amp;#39;re not working and showing errors, &amp;lt;here just put some more f-words from 50 year old lady, production leader, who looked a lot like Shrek after a car accident&amp;gt;&amp;quot;\nThe line was about 10 min. walk from my office so I stayed on the phone while I was walking there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Ok, tell me what is going on, calm down.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;YOU ARE MESSING WITH THE SYSTEMS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD ALL BE FIRED GOD DAMMIT, I AM WRITING TO YOUR MANAGER AS SOON AS IT WILL BE FIXED&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Please calm down, we were not doing anything with this since January (it was August).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;YEAH SURE, YOU NEVER ADMIT TO  A F$%@-UP&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I was already thinking about different ways of cutting her throat open, but still played it cool. \nI finally arrive at the line and ask her to hand me a scanner. All people from production line were standing there with crossed shoulders and looked at me like &amp;quot;Here you go, you messed up so fix it huh&amp;quot; and the leader said something like &amp;quot;Oh here you are, now make it work after you f***ed up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, the scanner was just something like a Windows PDA with scanning module.\nNothing fancy. All she had to do was to power it up, type username/password and it was ready to go, it was all about scanning the bar codes of airbag parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I take the scanner and look at the screen.\nBack at her.\nBack at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Were you asked to change password recently?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;YES, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT, WE DON&amp;#39;T HAVE TIME FOR SUCH BULLS**T&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Because the screen says that you have typed wrong password 5 times and you are always reminded that after this the scanner blocks for 20 minutes. And by the way you have 3 backup scanners so why you didn&amp;#39;t use them? You messed up, not me. And it&amp;#39;s not ok to talk like that to any employee of the company, so I will surely report it to YOUR manager - we have call recording enabled on our mobiles (we didn&amp;#39;t, but she could never know).&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Ugh... ummm, emmm.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Yea, bye.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told the story to her manager, she apologized officially the whole IT team, brought some cheapest cookies from the store and basically pretended to be sorry. Still IT was the most hated group in the company - but I guess that&amp;#39;s the way things are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Lol, I expected a 100 upvotes at most, but I see it exploded a bit over my expectations, and it&amp;#39;s not even the best of my stories :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "518hca", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "EpiphanyOfThings", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 374, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/518hca/once_upon_a_time_when_old_lady_blocked_a_whole/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/518hca/once_upon_a_time_when_old_lady_blocked_a_whole/", "subreddit_subscribers": 767512, "created_utc": 1473063680.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "selftext": "I've been out of the office for about a month so the day to day happenings such as construction and desk moves etc. have not been communicated to me.   \n\n\nThis morning I get to the office at 7:30AM and one of the facilities guys comes up to me and casually  says:  \"The electricians are cutting power to the server room some time today\". \n\nEnter Panic Mode Now...\n\nI state that they can't just turn off the power to the datacenter. there is a process that needs to happen for down time.

I CAN'T PRINT...\n\n*note - callers tone is very rude and I've reached my BS tolerance by this stage*\n\n**Me:** Yes we've established you can't print- what actually happens? what errors are received? What does the printer do?\n\n**Caller:** It tells me to top up my print credit as I have a negative balance of -$49 \n\n**Me:**...\n\n**Caller:** *HELLO!*\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, I don't see the issue here. You'll need to clear the $49 outstanding balance before you can print\n\n**Caller:** But I don't owe you any money!\n\n**Me:** Okay, are you saying this balance has been added to your account in error?\n\n**Caller:** No\n\n**Me:** Can you please explain what you mean?\n\n**Caller:** I was photocopying loads of personal pictures yesterday and since then I have this balance. But I don't think I owe this as I didn't get any warnings when photocopying\n\n**Me:**... But you're aware there's a charge for photocopying?\n\n**Caller:** YES OF COURSE I AM!\n\n**Me:** Okay, so I don't see why you're disputing the balance? You used a photocopier for a large job and as a result of this have a negative balance which will need to be cleared - regardless of \"warnings\" or not, you still used a service at the end of the day and need to pay for what you've used - you've just admitted you knew about the charge before using the service.\n\n**Caller:** I JUST NEED TO PRINT NOW!\n\n**Me:** Okay, you'll need to clear the balance on the account first by topping up\n\n**Caller:** BUT THIS IS URGENT!\n\n**Me:** It's 11 pm - I'm not sure what you're asking me to do. If you want to print you'll need to clear this balance by topping up your credit \n\n**Caller:** BUT I DON'T OWE YOU ANY MONEY!\n\n**Me:** You said you used the photocopiers?\n\n**Caller:** YES\n\n**Me:** Presumably you have the documents you photocopied?\n\n**Caller:** YES\n\n**Me:** So you have photocopied documents that you haven't paid for. The photocopiers should not be used for personal use either. What is it that you need to \"urgently\" print right now?\n\n**Caller:** I want to print a banner for a party\n\n**Me:** So, again you're using the printing facilities for personal reasons - in clear breach of the policy you agreed to.

For your entertainment, here it is.\n\nFirst a little background info to set the scene:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur company HQ building has big conference rooms. Despite not being in the events or hosting business at all, we sometimes rent those out if we don't need them ourselves. Only B2B, we only offer little service but that makes for a fair rate, all usually easy going, not much work and earns a few extra bucks.The day this story took place was one such time: A company that had rented our conference rooms before had booked them again, but this time for a completely different occasion, hence other guests in our house.\n\nRegarding technical equipment and support the rules were simple: We as the host provide you with one high quality projector per room, one HDMI cable, one audio cable if you want to use the room's speaker system, and one wifi voucher for each of the devices people need to present from. Everything other than that is your own business as a guest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year's autumn, when this happened, both the IT team and our facility department ^((not sure if that's the correct term, not a native speaker - the department who janitors, catering staff etc belong to)) were very short on staff thanks to a bad stomach flu going around. Preparing the conference rooms for renters hasn't been of my duties for years anymore, but due to the staff situation and still knowing how to do it, I helped out. Usually our main janitor prepares the room layout and our internal catering woman stays on standby for the guests, but both were sick. The only option to fill in their positions on short notice was to borrow Lucy, an apprentice from another department. She was fresh from school, had only started her apprenticeship a few weeks ago and didn't mind doing something completely different for a day. Naturally she needed instructing and some help with her newly assigned duties. It took longer than usual, but together we made sure everything is perfectly prepared in time for our guests. Prior to their arrival I had briefed her to call me personally if the guests require any IT help before I had to leave.\n\nSince I passed the conference area on the way through the building a little later on, I checked on Lucy and the guests. Quite a few had already arrived, but everything so far was good, projector and sound worked, she felt comfortable to handle the job, everything fine.\n\nHalf an hour passes by, then I receive a first call from Lucy. The guests wanted to know where they could get wifi vouchers. Dang, my bad, forgot to tell her. I sent her to the front desk to fetch one per device the guests need for their presentations.\n\nTen more minutes pass. Suddenly another call.\n\n&gt;Lucy, sounding strangely nervous: *\"Could you please come down? The guests need help with the wifi...\"*\n\nSince I'd never interacted with her before today, I couldn't quite place if the tone of her voice indicated a problem, or if she was just a little insecure and stressed now... Something felt off, though.\n\n&gt;Me: *\"Sure, don't worry, I'll be there in a few minutes, just gotta finish something real quick.\"*\n\nUpon entering the hallway to the conference rooms I could already hear an irritated woman's voice heavily berating somebody. Not a good sign. Worried now, I picked up my pace and turned around the final corner, only to find poor little Lucy cornered by a suited woman in her 40s whose voice I had heard, absolutely barking at her about not delivering what they paid for. Lucy was visibly shaking a little, probably getting close to a panic attack. After hearing my footsteps her eyes immediately made contact with mine, looking anxiously for help.\n\n&gt;Me, sharply: *\"Excuse me!\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woman: \"***WHAT?*** *Now who the* ***f\\*\\*\\**** *are you?\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *\"I'm from IT and here to help you with the wifi issue Lucy has contacted me about. What can I do for you?\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woman, still in a very angry tone: *\"We were promised wifi vouchers in the lease contract for the room, but* ***SHE*** *-\"* pointing her finger directly at Lucy, almost stabbing her in the eye - *\"refuses to hand out any!\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lucy, seemingly at the verge of tears now: *\"But I... I gave you one for your laptop, your tablet and your guest speaker's laptop...\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woman, shouting down on Lucy again: *\"AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? We have over 100 people here and EVERYONE needs wifi, you* ***stupid worthless \\*\\*\\*\\*****!\"*\n\nThose words really hurt and this new, unexpected toxic situation became too much to bear - tears welled up in Lucy's eyes. Before seeing this I already had more than enough of this woman's behavior, but now I snapped. This had to stop.\n\n&gt;Me: \"***HEY! STOP.*** *Calm down. Keep those insults to yourself, where are your manners?! Back off of her, she's just doing her job and following policy!\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woman, turning to me, cocky look on her face and maximum disdain in her voice: *\"Who do you think you are, telling me what to say or do, huh? And what stupid policy?! We were promised wifi, and that's what we're getting from you.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *\"The contract clearly states the IT policy for external guests, which -\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woman, cutting me off: *\"****DON'T. CARE.*** *You two drones are utterly useless and should get* ***fired!*** *Get me the manager in charge,* ***NOW!****\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *\"Alright. As you wish. Be right back.\"*\n\nWith that the woman stormed off, back into the conference room. I gestured Lucy to come with me and she immediately followed, glad to get away and barely keeping it together. We made our way around the corner, back to the elevators, when I stopped and put my hand on one of Lucy's shoulders, getting her to look up at me.\n\n&gt;Me: *\"I'm so sorry you were treated like that. Are you OK?\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lucy nodded and took a deep breath, slowly regaining her composure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me, continuing walking with her: *\"Listen, you don't have to accept this sort of behavior, neither as an apprentice nor as anyone else. Feel free to simply walk away next time and report to a manager.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lucy: *\"OK. I will.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *\"Don't let those hurtful words get to you - forget everything she said, you were doing a great job. Really, I mean it, and am very proud of you standing your ground.\"*\n\nWe reached the elevators and entered one. I pushed the button to the executive floor.\n\n&gt;Lucy: *\"Where are we going now?\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *\"My office. At least, I will. You go fetch a cup of hot chocolate or whatever you like from the machine next to the elevators, it's free. Have a seat on the sofa then. I'll be back in a few minutes.\"*\n\nLucy looked confused, but complied. Meanwhile I went through the adjacent hallway door - and into my office. Since I knew in advance I'd help get the conference room ready due to filling in for the missing sysadmin in my team, but had an important meeting in the afternoon, I had changed from my slacks into jeans (which I keep in my wardrobe for such occasions) earlier and left my suit jacket and tie by my desk. Now I reverted those changes, made a few quick phone calls and returned to Lucy all dressed up. Her eyes grew wide.\n\n&gt;Lucy: *\"This question might sound stupid now, sorry, but... who are you exactly?\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me, smiling: *\"I do work in IT, but I am the CIO. Since so many of my people are sick right now I'm filling in for them. That's why I helped you set up the room instead of Ben, who'd usually do this. And now, since that lovely woman down there asked for management attention, we'll teach her a lesson in respect. Follow me.\"*\n\nWith that we made our way down to the conference rooms again.\n\n&gt;Me, mockingly straighting my tie and suit jacket: *\"Lucy, would you* ***please*** *be so kind to inform our guest that the manager in charge is here now?\"*\n\nShe grinned and did as requested. Immediately I could hear a faint *\"Finally, everything takes too damn long around here!\"* before the woman hurried through the door towards me. When she recognized me, she froze in her tracks.\n\n&gt;Me: *\"Good morning. My name is &lt;roflcopter-pilot&gt;, I'm the CIO of &lt;company&gt; and therefore the manager in charge regarding your issue, who you demanded to speak.\"*\n\nCalmly I walked towards her, reached into my jacket and gave her my business card. The woman took it, but not being able to throw anybody under the bus apparently left her without a plan and speechless.\n\n&gt;Me: *\"Now that I got your attention, I have three things to tell you.*  \n*One: You stated that you 'were promised wifi' and that you 'want to get what you pay for'. You signed a contract stating that you get wifi access for every device needed for your presentations, which we delivered. We neither can nor will provide access for all attendees of your event. Our network, our rules. Period.*  \n*Two: Your condescending, rude tone is bad enough in itself, but verbally abusing and intimidating employees, especially* ***a minor like in this case***, *absolutely won't be tolerated around here! I expect a sincere apology of yours to Lucy and myself.\"*\n\nShe slowly found the ability to speak again.\n\n&gt;Woman: *\"OK, I apologize, that was not very professional of me. But -\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me, interrupting her: *\"That's a massive understatement and doesn't sound terribly sincere to me. Furthermore, point three: Verbal assault and intimidation are against our house rules, which we strictly enforce and you agreed to adhere to by signing the rental contract. This alone warrants your personal removal from our premises. Also you apparently invited more than 100 people, which you weren't allowed to do and violates fire code rules, since the maximum room capacity is exactly 100, as stated in the contract. Due to now multiple breaches of contract and said fire code violations I herewith have to ask you and your guests to leave. By the way, according to internal consultation we have not the* ***slightest*** *further interest in renting out our rooms to your company, considering the circumstances. Please gather your people, personal belongings and then leave our premises.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short from here on:\n\nShe of course threw a massive hissy fit, questioned my authority some more and needed to be guided out by security. The other people from her company were confused and understandably not amused, but cooperated in a civil manner.\n\nA week later she had her lawyer send us a letter claiming unfair treatment and requesting a refund, which gave our lawyer a big laugh and the opportunity to lay out to their counterpart how they breached the contract in great detail. That was the last we heard from them, thankfully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT:\\*\\*  \nSo many awards in such a quick time, y'all are insane, thank you!

For your entertainment, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First a little background info to set the scene:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our company HQ building has big conference rooms. Despite not being in the events or hosting business at all, we sometimes rent those out if we don&amp;#39;t need them ourselves. Only B2B, we only offer little service but that makes for a fair rate, all usually easy going, not much work and earns a few extra bucks.The day this story took place was one such time: A company that had rented our conference rooms before had booked them again, but this time for a completely different occasion, hence other guests in our house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding technical equipment and support the rules were simple: We as the host provide you with one high quality projector per room, one HDMI cable, one audio cable if you want to use the room&amp;#39;s speaker system, and one wifi voucher for each of the devices people need to present from. Everything other than that is your own business as a guest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;#39;s autumn, when this happened, both the IT team and our facility department &lt;sup&gt;(not sure if that&amp;#39;s the correct term, not a native speaker - the department who janitors, catering staff etc belong to&lt;/sup&gt;) were very short on staff thanks to a bad stomach flu going around. Preparing the conference rooms for renters hasn&amp;#39;t been of my duties for years anymore, but due to the staff situation and still knowing how to do it, I helped out. Usually our main janitor prepares the room layout and our internal catering woman stays on standby for the guests, but both were sick. The only option to fill in their positions on short notice was to borrow Lucy, an apprentice from another department. She was fresh from school, had only started her apprenticeship a few weeks ago and didn&amp;#39;t mind doing something completely different for a day. Naturally she needed instructing and some help with her newly assigned duties. It took longer than usual, but together we made sure everything is perfectly prepared in time for our guests. Prior to their arrival I had briefed her to call me personally if the guests require any IT help before I had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I passed the conference area on the way through the building a little later on, I checked on Lucy and the guests. Quite a few had already arrived, but everything so far was good, projector and sound worked, she felt comfortable to handle the job, everything fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half an hour passes by, then I receive a first call from Lucy. The guests wanted to know where they could get wifi vouchers. Dang, my bad, forgot to tell her. I sent her to the front desk to fetch one per device the guests need for their presentations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten more minutes pass. Suddenly another call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy, sounding strangely nervous: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Could you please come down? The guests need help with the wifi...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;d never interacted with her before today, I couldn&amp;#39;t quite place if the tone of her voice indicated a problem, or if she was just a little insecure and stressed now... Something felt off, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sure, don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;ll be there in a few minutes, just gotta finish something real quick.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon entering the hallway to the conference rooms I could already hear an irritated woman&amp;#39;s voice heavily berating somebody. Not a good sign. Worried now, I picked up my pace and turned around the final corner, only to find poor little Lucy cornered by a suited woman in her 40s whose voice I had heard, absolutely barking at her about not delivering what they paid for. Lucy was visibly shaking a little, probably getting close to a panic attack. After hearing my footsteps her eyes immediately made contact with mine, looking anxiously for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me, sharply: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woman: &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Now who the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;f\\&lt;/em&gt;*\\&lt;/strong&gt;** &lt;em&gt;are you?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m from IT and here to help you with the wifi issue Lucy has contacted me about. What can I do for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woman, still in a very angry tone: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We were promised wifi vouchers in the lease contract for the room, but&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; pointing her finger directly at Lucy, almost stabbing her in the eye - &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;refuses to hand out any!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy, seemingly at the verge of tears now: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But I... I gave you one for your laptop, your tablet and your guest speaker&amp;#39;s laptop...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woman, shouting down on Lucy again: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? We have over 100 people here and EVERYONE needs wifi, you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stupid worthless \\&lt;/em&gt;**\\&lt;/strong&gt;**&lt;em&gt;!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those words really hurt and this new, unexpected toxic situation became too much to bear - tears welled up in Lucy&amp;#39;s eyes. Before seeing this I already had more than enough of this woman&amp;#39;s behavior, but now I snapped. This had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HEY! STOP.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Calm down. Keep those insults to yourself, where are your manners?! Back off of her, she&amp;#39;s just doing her job and following policy!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woman, turning to me, cocky look on her face and maximum disdain in her voice: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Who do you think you are, telling me what to say or do, huh? And what stupid policy?! We were promised wifi, and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re getting from you.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The contract clearly states the IT policy for external guests, which -&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woman, cutting me off: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DON&amp;#39;T. CARE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You two drones are utterly useless and should get&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fired!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Get me the manager in charge,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOW!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Alright. As you wish. Be right back.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that the woman stormed off, back into the conference room. I gestured Lucy to come with me and she immediately followed, glad to get away and barely keeping it together. We made our way around the corner, back to the elevators, when I stopped and put my hand on one of Lucy&amp;#39;s shoulders, getting her to look up at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry you were treated like that. Are you OK?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy nodded and took a deep breath, slowly regaining her composure.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me, continuing walking with her: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, you don&amp;#39;t have to accept this sort of behavior, neither as an apprentice nor as anyone else. Feel free to simply walk away next time and report to a manager.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;OK. I will.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let those hurtful words get to you - forget everything she said, you were doing a great job. Really, I mean it, and am very proud of you standing your ground.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We reached the elevators and entered one. I pushed the button to the executive floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Where are we going now?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;My office. At least, I will. You go fetch a cup of hot chocolate or whatever you like from the machine next to the elevators, it&amp;#39;s free. Have a seat on the sofa then. I&amp;#39;ll be back in a few minutes.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy looked confused, but complied. Meanwhile I went through the adjacent hallway door - and into my office. Since I knew in advance I&amp;#39;d help get the conference room ready due to filling in for the missing sysadmin in my team, but had an important meeting in the afternoon, I had changed from my slacks into jeans (which I keep in my wardrobe for such occasions) earlier and left my suit jacket and tie by my desk. Now I reverted those changes, made a few quick phone calls and returned to Lucy all dressed up. Her eyes grew wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lucy: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This question might sound stupid now, sorry, but... who are you exactly?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me, smiling: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I do work in IT, but I am the CIO. Since so many of my people are sick right now I&amp;#39;m filling in for them. That&amp;#39;s why I helped you set up the room instead of Ben, who&amp;#39;d usually do this. And now, since that lovely woman down there asked for management attention, we&amp;#39;ll teach her a lesson in respect. Follow me.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that we made our way down to the conference rooms again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me, mockingly straighting my tie and suit jacket: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Lucy, would you&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;be so kind to inform our guest that the manager in charge is here now?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She grinned and did as requested. Immediately I could hear a faint &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Finally, everything takes too damn long around here!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; before the woman hurried through the door towards me. When she recognized me, she froze in her tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning. My name is &amp;lt;roflcopter-pilot&amp;gt;, I&amp;#39;m the CIO of &amp;lt;company&amp;gt; and therefore the manager in charge regarding your issue, who you demanded to speak.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Calmly I walked towards her, reached into my jacket and gave her my business card. The woman took it, but not being able to throw anybody under the bus apparently left her without a plan and speechless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Now that I got your attention, I have three things to tell you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;One: You stated that you &amp;#39;were promised wifi&amp;#39; and that you &amp;#39;want to get what you pay for&amp;#39;. You signed a contract stating that you get wifi access for every device needed for your presentations, which we delivered. We neither can nor will provide access for all attendees of your event. Our network, our rules. Period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Two: Your condescending, rude tone is bad enough in itself, but verbally abusing and intimidating employees, especially&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a minor like in this case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;absolutely won&amp;#39;t be tolerated around here! I expect a sincere apology of yours to Lucy and myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She slowly found the ability to speak again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Woman: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;OK, I apologize, that was not very professional of me. But -&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me, interrupting her: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a massive understatement and doesn&amp;#39;t sound terribly sincere to me. Furthermore, point three: Verbal assault and intimidation are against our house rules, which we strictly enforce and you agreed to adhere to by signing the rental contract. This alone warrants your personal removal from our premises. Also you apparently invited more than 100 people, which you weren&amp;#39;t allowed to do and violates fire code rules, since the maximum room capacity is exactly 100, as stated in the contract. Due to now multiple breaches of contract and said fire code violations I herewith have to ask you and your guests to leave. By the way, according to internal consultation we have not the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;slightest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;further interest in renting out our rooms to your company, considering the circumstances. Please gather your people, personal belongings and then leave our premises.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short from here on:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She of course threw a massive hissy fit, questioned my authority some more and needed to be guided out by security. The other people from her company were confused and understandably not amused, but cooperated in a civil manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later she had her lawyer send us a letter claiming unfair treatment and requesting a refund, which gave our lawyer a big laugh and the opportunity to lay out to their counterpart how they breached the contract in great detail. That was the last we heard from them, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**EDIT:**&lt;br/&gt;\nSo many awards in such a quick time, y&amp;#39;all are insane, thank you!

You're still using it?\n\n&gt; **Boss** 2001.. Yes we are. But today in the morning the program stopped working.\n\nOh, nostalgia... Anyway. I decided to troubleshoot quickly, learning about the details. Thankfully I have archives for all my codes, even my first ever program coded in GWBasic.\n\nOf course, even coded 15 years ago, a program doesn't suddenly stop working in a day. I try to find out what has changed. Nothing seems to have changed since yesterday. Maybe a blackout? No. Changes in network? Nope. Changes in any hardware? None...\n\nIt will indeed take time.\n\n&gt; **Me** All right, &lt;boss&gt;.. I guess I can't solve it from afar. I seriously doubt it's a problem in my code but just in case, I will provide you the source codes. It's possibly a simple problem in hardware and you wouldn't want to pay me for that. A local tech will do it for much less.\n\n&gt; **Boss** Pay you? Why should we pay you? It's your program. Fix it.\n\n&gt; **Me** *(after a hearty laugh)* It's a freelance job I did for you literally fifteen years ago. As you're the witness, it had worked well until this morning. Even if it was the product of a giant company, the support would have been dropped already. Think about it, Microsoft has dropped support for XP. You can't expect me to offer free support.\n\n&gt; **Boss** We still want you to fix it. How much would you charge?\n\n&gt; **Me** I'm working for another company already. First I'll have to ask for unpaid vacation. Then I'll bill all my expenses to you in addition to &lt;rate&gt; per day. I doubt it'll take more than a single day, though.\n\n&gt; **Boss** It's too much.\n\n&gt; **Me** I know. That's why I urge you to find a local tech and have him have a look. If it's proven that the problem is my code, I'll happily send you the source codes and then you may have it updated to your heart's content.\n\n&gt; **Boss** I don't understand why the passage of time should change it. It's your program. You should fix it.\n\n&gt; **Me** It doesn't work like that. Anyway, I'll be awaiting your call from this number. Also my mail is &lt;mail&gt;.\n\nHe hung up, still muttering about how it's my program and I should fix it for free.\n\nI'm dreaming about the future now. I wonder if I'll receive a call in 20 years, telling about a faulty program of mine I coded in 2003?\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nI... didn't know people will be that much interested in my story...\n\nThere are too many comments asking about the same stuff and I'm.... lazy.. Forgive me.\n\nI got my first phone number in '99. Never changed it. The company would find me anyway, I have social media accounts with photos of mine, my name's common but surname's rather unique, my father still lives in that city and he's pretty well-known anyway..\n\nThe program was written with C#, .NET 2.0, but no, updates in .NET Framework didn't cause it, .NET Framework and the newer ones always support 2.0 without installing anything. Yes I know it's doesn't work the same with 3.5 but please be my guest and try, make a very simple 2.0 application and run it in a brand new Windows 8 computer, it'll work.\n\nYeah they used to use Win98 then and .NET Framework had to be installed. But if I remember correctly it was a simple 20mb file. I knew only Delphi and C# to easily make a windows application then and I've always hated Delphi with a passion.\n\nThe computers that couldn't connect to the system in question all had a horde of trojans, I suspect it was because of the cracked Need for Speed I saw in all of them. I don't know why but the computer refused to connect to anywhere local. I didn't care or investigate really, I decided I won't waste time cleaning everything, I made a factory reset, created user accounts without admin privileges and gave the admin password to the boss.", "author_fullname": "t2_oodix", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Decades may pass.

How much would you charge?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m working for another company already. First I&amp;#39;ll have to ask for unpaid vacation. Then I&amp;#39;ll bill all my expenses to you in addition to &amp;lt;rate&amp;gt; per day. I doubt it&amp;#39;ll take more than a single day, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boss&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; I know. That&amp;#39;s why I urge you to find a local tech and have him have a look. If it&amp;#39;s proven that the problem is my code, I&amp;#39;ll happily send you the source codes and then you may have it updated to your heart&amp;#39;s content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boss&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t understand why the passage of time should change it. It&amp;#39;s your program. You should fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn&amp;#39;t work like that. Anyway, I&amp;#39;ll be awaiting your call from this number. Also my mail is &amp;lt;mail&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He hung up, still muttering about how it&amp;#39;s my program and I should fix it for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m dreaming about the future now. I wonder if I&amp;#39;ll receive a call in 20 years, telling about a faulty program of mine I coded in 2003?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I... didn&amp;#39;t know people will be that much interested in my story...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are too many comments asking about the same stuff and I&amp;#39;m.... lazy.. Forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first phone number in &amp;#39;99. Never changed it. The company would find me anyway, I have social media accounts with photos of mine, my name&amp;#39;s common but surname&amp;#39;s rather unique, my father still lives in that city and he&amp;#39;s pretty well-known anyway..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The program was written with C#, .NET 2.0, but no, updates in .NET Framework didn&amp;#39;t cause it, .NET Framework and the newer ones always support 2.0 without installing anything. Yes I know it&amp;#39;s doesn&amp;#39;t work the same with 3.5 but please be my guest and try, make a very simple 2.0 application and run it in a brand new Windows 8 computer, it&amp;#39;ll work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah they used to use Win98 then and .NET Framework had to be installed. But if I remember correctly it was a simple 20mb file. I knew only Delphi and C# to easily make a windows application then and I&amp;#39;ve always hated Delphi with a passion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The computers that couldn&amp;#39;t connect to the system in question all had a horde of trojans, I suspect it was because of the cracked Need for Speed I saw in all of them. I don&amp;#39;t know why but the computer refused to connect to anywhere local. I didn&amp;#39;t care or investigate really, I decided I won&amp;#39;t waste time cleaning everything, I made a factory reset, created user accounts without admin privileges and gave the admin password to the boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sfg5", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "4iufbs", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "hwaa", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 594, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4iufbs/decades_may_pass_youre_still_responsible/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4iufbs/decades_may_pass_youre_still_responsible/", "subreddit_subscribers": 767512, "created_utc": 1462965444.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "talesfromtechsupport", "selftext": "I work for an ISP that deals only in DSL-type connections.

You have been warned.\n\n[Previous Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/search?q=author%3ATheLightningcount1&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)\n\n&gt; $ME = Me (You know its serious when I just list me as me)\n\n&gt; $DA = Double agent, our spy. \n\n&gt; $SN = Snitch\n\n&gt; $WL = Wahoo lady in her final appearance. \n\n&gt; $Rec = Contracting company recruiter. \n\nWe are getting out of the realm of ancient history and into the realm of recent events now. Another post I made about this company recently helped set off the catalyst for the endgame. \n\nThe time of our spies party was drawing closer and the information we needed was being collected. I was still getting the reports of the snitch not playing ball with our ticketing system. Cherry picking the best tickets, ending calls before confirming tickets were resolved, making people call back later in the day for non existent server issues, and simply just not doing his job. On top of this we started collecting his email logs between him and the sales manager who was his \"real\" boss. \n\nYes. You read that correctly. He was using company email to communicate with the sales manager who put him up to it and when we found this out it was like Jebus himself placed the holy grail onto our desk and told us to drink it up beehotches. That's one. \n\nOnce I had everything that I needed from my team I told them to return to normal in regards to the snitch. No longer needed anything else on that front so I let my team know to watch their backs and let them know to just continue working. Everything was being handled and we were in the endgame here. We had two termination level offenses. Three more to go. \n\nSeeing as the snitch figured he was above the law we had been collected his usage data in significant portions. This paid off really well in a way we did not expect. We expected him to use youtube when it was unblocked on the firewall, but it never came up in his history. It was strange because he had his headphones on quite a bit even when he was not on a call. Our server guys gave us the reason for that. Seems he had made his own website to get around our youtube monitoring. It was a simple white page with a single input. When you paste a youtube video's URL into the bar it plays the video in embedded mode. Since he was not going to youtube's website, it never raised any red flags. \n\nI walked over to the snitch and had a small conversation with him over it. \n\n&gt; $ME - You aren't in trouble but there have been rumors that you have been on youtube. I do not care whether you were or were not there. I am just warning you that people are watching. IF you are caught on youtube you will be written up and walked out. \n\n&gt; $SN - Sure thing man. Thanks for the heads up. \n\n&gt; $ME - No problem. Keep up the good work. \n\nI had the server guys set up a redirect on our firewall to a section of our domain. The website it redirected to was a white website just like his, only instead of an input box it just had the text of. \"I warned you. Come to my desk now.\"\n\nIt took two hours after the conversation and redirect were set up for him to come to me. I already had the write up ready and simply asked him to sign it. I told him to return to his desk and get back to work. \n\nThis was three. \n\nThe day of the party was the day of the second write up for the snitch. Our spy sent me a text message Saturday telling me to call him ASAP. \n\n&gt; $Me - Whats up?\n\n&gt; $DA - You need to drug test snitch asap. \n\n&gt; $ME - Details. I need lots of details. \n\n&gt; $DA - He brought weed to my party and smoked it with a friend of his. \n\nI hung up with DA and called my boss. \n\n&gt; $HIT - Its Saturday. What?\n\n&gt; $ME - Snitch smoked weed at spy's party. \n\n&gt; $HIT - *Hilarious laughter over his side of the line.* You know what to do Monday then. \n\nWe ended the call and prepared for Monday. We were not prepared for Monday. I informed the Wahoo Lady of the issue Monday but something broke with the citrix servers causing everyone's files to no longer show up. My role in that fiasco was handling angry calls and assuring people we had backups of everything and that the server team was locking it down. Wednesday of that week was the day that Wahoo Lady made her mistake and accidentally allowed access to our database to unauthorized users costing the company millions of dollars to fix it. I refer you to my post history here for that story. This put a hold on our plans as we had to clean up the mess from $WL but she did give me a nice going away present. \n\nIn the other thread I mentioned my final words to her were just BS talking. This was a lie. We did have our nice exchange of goodbyes and I did give her a going away hug, but between those events she gave me a present. \n\n&gt; $WL - I have a solution to your snitch problem. \n\n&gt; $ME - How do you know about that?\n\n&gt; $WL - Contrary to the aloof misguided individual you write me as on reddit, I am very good at my job. Just like you have said in your posts. \n\n&gt; $ME - I change a lot of details and embellish conversations in my post to protect identities, how do you know about my posts? (Which is Ironic because this conversation has almost no edits in it.)\n\n&gt; $WL - I am very good at my job. Was good at my job. \n\nShe then opened her phone up and pulled up facebook and showed me the snitch's profile. \n\n&gt; $WL - Take a look at his pictures. \n\nI scroll through and I see a lot of pictures of the sales manager in them. A large amount of pictures of the sales manager in them. \n\n&gt; $ME - They are friends? So they hang out together. \n\n&gt; $WL - Yes they hang out together, go to the movies together, eat lunch and dinner together, go to six flags together, golf together, adopt puppies together. Eat dinner one night and get breakfast the next day together. Dress up as Bert and Ernie on halloween together. \n\nThe realization of what she was saying hit me and my eyes went wide. All kinds of scenarios went through my head but I could not bring myself to actually do them. I just sat in her chair and rubbed my temples.  \n\n&gt; $ME - I cant use this information. As much as I do not like them and as much as I just want to use this info to light the fire and watch it rise, I will not do that. I cant.\n\n&gt; $WL - You do not have to because I already did it. I shared this information with both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. \n\n&gt; $ME - Why?\n\n&gt; $WL - I like you. I do not like him. (Sales manager) Also we have rules regarding disclosing relationships between employees and management.\n\n&gt; $ME - You know he is married right? This has the chance to ruin his marriage. \n\n&gt; $WL - It will be handled quietly. But you need to get rid of the snitch on your own first before anything can happen. Upper management bows to this guys whims because he makes the money. But if you had a sure fire reason for the snitch to get fired then sales manager will lose his edge and likely his eyes and ears into your department. In the mean time I let the VPs know of the relationship but they do not know that he is snitching for the sales manager. \n\nNow it made sense how this guy got hired in the first place. Sales manager put in a good word for snitch and snitch got the job. Snitch did not actually become a snitch until January when sales manager did not get his promised promotion because they expanded the IT department threefold reducing the budget for his promotion and pay bump. In his warped mind the only solution was to fire off the IT people and free up the money. \n\nArmed with this new knowledge I left her former office feeling physically sick and got back to work fixing the major eff up she caused. Once things had stabilized, about a week later, I went to HR again and talked to the new head of HR. I let her know about the party and let her know about the weed and told her that I needed to have him drug tested asap. \n\nIt turns out that a company wide drug test was actually already in the works in the form of entire offices being tested over the course of the month. So they just bumped up our office to be the next one tested. We do hair tests at our work so you can imagine the amount of people who just randomly decided to cut their hair after the email went out. \n\nA few days later the company we hired to do the drug tests showed up at our office to collect samples. We did not even wait for the results of the drug test before we started to act. We called his contracting company and told them we wanted to terminate his contract regardless of the results of the drug test but to wait for the results to come in. We had enough to fire him without the drugs, but those helped too. Funnily enough, sales manager decided it was a good time to go on vacation the day of the drug test and had been out since they cut the hair till the end of my post. \n\nIt took a week but he came back positive for not just weed. Speed, heroin, and zanex and a few others. This was fireable offense 4,5,6,7,8,9 through goddamn 1000. HR got with us about the positive tests and informed them of our plan to drop him immediately at the beginning of the day that Monday. They set everything up and informed security of the plan. \n\nMonday morning security informed me of when his badge was activated on the door. I intercepted him at his desk and did not let him work. I asked him to come with me for a meeting and to keep up. I walked quickly to the meeting room and opened the door for him. On one side of the table were our head of HR, $HIT, a lawyer for the company, a lawyer for the contracting company, and various other managers from other departments who wanted to sit in and evaluate me. (I am being groomed for management in IT) Most of the other people were merely there to observe and said nothing.  \n\nI asked him to sit down on the other side of the table and sat right across from him. Everyone stared at him for a second before my boss started talking. \n\n&gt; $HIT - We are letting you go. \n\n&gt; $SN - Why? (He responded really quickly in a surprised tone.)\n\n&gt; $HIT - Really? You have no clue why? (He was actually mad because he read through the emails and was about to go off on Snitch)\n\n I laid three files in front of him quickly not wanting $HIT to lose it and blow it for us. \n\n&gt; $Me - This file here is your ticket logs. You cherry pick the tickets you want to work and then dump the calls when they turn out to be harder than you thought. *I pointed to the next one* Here is your internet usage proving that you bypassed monitoring to youtube without us knowing what you were doing. You then continued to use youtube even after I gave you a friendly warning. *Pointed to the third file.* And this one is the email logs with the sales manager proving your relationship to him and your plan to gut our department for his personal revenge. You have actively worked against us since the citrix project finished and we were transferred to the helpdesk. \n\n&gt; $HIT - *Lays a paper in front of him.* And this is your drug test. You tested positive for 3 illegal substances, and 2 prescription substances. They also found chemicals consistent with over the counter body detox kits people think allow them to beat drug tests. I would ask you for the prescriptions for the two you tested positive for, but that is moot since the illegal drugs have already sealed the deal. \n\n&gt; $me - There is a lot I want to say right now. You have no clue how badly I wanted to say these things, but given the circumstances it would be inappropriate. You were a good migration tech, but your quality as a worker deteriorated slowly. I can see why now. I recommend you get treatment for your addictions. I have lost friends for those same drugs and I do not want to see you in the papers one day. Your recruiter will give you some information for some free drug programs if you are interested. \n\nI motioned to the recruiter for his contracting company to come in and he was served his termination papers. \n\n&gt; $REC - Here are your termination papers. Unfortunately since you tested positive for drugs we must also remove you from our recruitment lists. We wish you luck in your future endeavors and I personally hope you get the help you need for your addictions. \n\nHis recruiter then handed him a pamphlet for a local, mostly, free drug program for getting people clean. \n\nThe snitch sat there with the most defeated look on his face. He was breathing so heavily I thought he was having a heart attack. Security came in and asked for his badge snapping him out of his stupor. He was almost in tears as he handed his badge. We informed them of the BYOD status on his phone and he handed it to be wiped using the iPhone reset option. (NEVER do BYOD people. EVER.) It looked like he was going to say something during this entire process but he just used breathing techniques to keep himself calm. (I think they were breathing techniques at least.) He was then escorted out of the room. \n\n&gt; $REC - I need to apologize to you for the trouble my employee caused you. \n\nMe and $Hit both told him not to worry about it. Legal and everyone else reviewed the case and all agreed we were pretty much in the clear on everything. (Substance abuse terminations require legal oversight to insure everything was handled properly.) The tapes for the meeting were pulled and sent to the VP of IT for review. \n\nI sent the email logs to both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. \n\nOnce everything was said and done I sat down and started typing up this story. Yes I started typing up this story about an hour after we let the snitch go. Halfway through typing up part 4 the VP of sales called me and $HIT into his office. He wanted to apologize for the actions of the sales manager and informed us that they asked for his resignation. All parties agreed that him leaving quietly was for the best of everyone involved. The VP personally apologized to me and $HIT and said that this company was not in the policy of creating hostile work environments for its employees. He gave us his personal guarantee that if anything happened like this again, he would squash it personally. On a personal note he asked us to unblock Facebook so his employees can stop complaining. He said that no one actually cared about that rule before. It was only there to get rid of dead weight or to trim. \n\nWe thanked him for that and  I went back to my desk to finish typing up this story. All websites were unblocked and everyone started listening to music on youtube again as well as watching sick game footage from *insert game here.* while they worked. \n\n That is that people. We won the battle, the war, and got the VP to agree to our terms. I felt so relieved that the cancer of our team was gone. I can not say I was happy because of the way it happened, but I can say that I was satisfied with the outcome. Not good and not bad but acceptable. Normally when I have seen or had to let someone go I felt bad. But the only thing I felt from snitch was betrayal and pity. He used my trust and abused my good will and it hurt all the same. But it was a different kind of hurt this time. \n\nFRIDAY EDIT: Even today, five days after writing this, I feel bad for the guy and honestly hope he gets the help he needs. I just hope I never have to go through this again.

Eat dinner one night and get breakfast the next day together. Dress up as Bert and Ernie on halloween together. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The realization of what she was saying hit me and my eyes went wide. All kinds of scenarios went through my head but I could not bring myself to actually do them. I just sat in her chair and rubbed my temples.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$ME - I cant use this information. As much as I do not like them and as much as I just want to use this info to light the fire and watch it rise, I will not do that. I cant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$WL - You do not have to because I already did it. I shared this information with both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$ME - Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$WL - I like you. I do not like him. (Sales manager) Also we have rules regarding disclosing relationships between employees and management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$ME - You know he is married right? This has the chance to ruin his marriage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$WL - It will be handled quietly. But you need to get rid of the snitch on your own first before anything can happen. Upper management bows to this guys whims because he makes the money. But if you had a sure fire reason for the snitch to get fired then sales manager will lose his edge and likely his eyes and ears into your department. In the mean time I let the VPs know of the relationship but they do not know that he is snitching for the sales manager. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it made sense how this guy got hired in the first place. Sales manager put in a good word for snitch and snitch got the job. Snitch did not actually become a snitch until January when sales manager did not get his promised promotion because they expanded the IT department threefold reducing the budget for his promotion and pay bump. In his warped mind the only solution was to fire off the IT people and free up the money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Armed with this new knowledge I left her former office feeling physically sick and got back to work fixing the major eff up she caused. Once things had stabilized, about a week later, I went to HR again and talked to the new head of HR. I let her know about the party and let her know about the weed and told her that I needed to have him drug tested asap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a company wide drug test was actually already in the works in the form of entire offices being tested over the course of the month. So they just bumped up our office to be the next one tested. We do hair tests at our work so you can imagine the amount of people who just randomly decided to cut their hair after the email went out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later the company we hired to do the drug tests showed up at our office to collect samples. We did not even wait for the results of the drug test before we started to act. We called his contracting company and told them we wanted to terminate his contract regardless of the results of the drug test but to wait for the results to come in. We had enough to fire him without the drugs, but those helped too. Funnily enough, sales manager decided it was a good time to go on vacation the day of the drug test and had been out since they cut the hair till the end of my post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a week but he came back positive for not just weed. Speed, heroin, and zanex and a few others. This was fireable offense 4,5,6,7,8,9 through goddamn 1000. HR got with us about the positive tests and informed them of our plan to drop him immediately at the beginning of the day that Monday. They set everything up and informed security of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday morning security informed me of when his badge was activated on the door. I intercepted him at his desk and did not let him work. I asked him to come with me for a meeting and to keep up. I walked quickly to the meeting room and opened the door for him. On one side of the table were our head of HR, $HIT, a lawyer for the company, a lawyer for the contracting company, and various other managers from other departments who wanted to sit in and evaluate me. (I am being groomed for management in IT) Most of the other people were merely there to observe and said nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him to sit down on the other side of the table and sat right across from him. Everyone stared at him for a second before my boss started talking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$HIT - We are letting you go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$SN - Why? (He responded really quickly in a surprised tone.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$HIT - Really? You have no clue why? (He was actually mad because he read through the emails and was about to go off on Snitch)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laid three files in front of him quickly not wanting $HIT to lose it and blow it for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$Me - This file here is your ticket logs. You cherry pick the tickets you want to work and then dump the calls when they turn out to be harder than you thought. &lt;em&gt;I pointed to the next one&lt;/em&gt; Here is your internet usage proving that you bypassed monitoring to youtube without us knowing what you were doing. You then continued to use youtube even after I gave you a friendly warning. &lt;em&gt;Pointed to the third file.&lt;/em&gt; And this one is the email logs with the sales manager proving your relationship to him and your plan to gut our department for his personal revenge. You have actively worked against us since the citrix project finished and we were transferred to the helpdesk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$HIT - &lt;em&gt;Lays a paper in front of him.&lt;/em&gt; And this is your drug test. You tested positive for 3 illegal substances, and 2 prescription substances. They also found chemicals consistent with over the counter body detox kits people think allow them to beat drug tests. I would ask you for the prescriptions for the two you tested positive for, but that is moot since the illegal drugs have already sealed the deal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$me - There is a lot I want to say right now. You have no clue how badly I wanted to say these things, but given the circumstances it would be inappropriate. You were a good migration tech, but your quality as a worker deteriorated slowly. I can see why now. I recommend you get treatment for your addictions. I have lost friends for those same drugs and I do not want to see you in the papers one day. Your recruiter will give you some information for some free drug programs if you are interested. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I motioned to the recruiter for his contracting company to come in and he was served his termination papers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$REC - Here are your termination papers. Unfortunately since you tested positive for drugs we must also remove you from our recruitment lists. We wish you luck in your future endeavors and I personally hope you get the help you need for your addictions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His recruiter then handed him a pamphlet for a local, mostly, free drug program for getting people clean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The snitch sat there with the most defeated look on his face. He was breathing so heavily I thought he was having a heart attack. Security came in and asked for his badge snapping him out of his stupor. He was almost in tears as he handed his badge. We informed them of the BYOD status on his phone and he handed it to be wiped using the iPhone reset option. (NEVER do BYOD people. EVER.) It looked like he was going to say something during this entire process but he just used breathing techniques to keep himself calm. (I think they were breathing techniques at least.) He was then escorted out of the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$REC - I need to apologize to you for the trouble my employee caused you. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and $Hit both told him not to worry about it. Legal and everyone else reviewed the case and all agreed we were pretty much in the clear on everything. (Substance abuse terminations require legal oversight to insure everything was handled properly.) The tapes for the meeting were pulled and sent to the VP of IT for review. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent the email logs to both the VP of IT and the VP of sales. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once everything was said and done I sat down and started typing up this story. Yes I started typing up this story about an hour after we let the snitch go. Halfway through typing up part 4 the VP of sales called me and $HIT into his office. He wanted to apologize for the actions of the sales manager and informed us that they asked for his resignation. All parties agreed that him leaving quietly was for the best of everyone involved. The VP personally apologized to me and $HIT and said that this company was not in the policy of creating hostile work environments for its employees. He gave us his personal guarantee that if anything happened like this again, he would squash it personally. On a personal note he asked us to unblock Facebook so his employees can stop complaining. He said that no one actually cared about that rule before. It was only there to get rid of dead weight or to trim. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We thanked him for that and  I went back to my desk to finish typing up this story. All websites were unblocked and everyone started listening to music on youtube again as well as watching sick game footage from &lt;em&gt;insert game here.&lt;/em&gt; while they worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is that people. We won the battle, the war, and got the VP to agree to our terms. I felt so relieved that the cancer of our team was gone. I can not say I was happy because of the way it happened, but I can say that I was satisfied with the outcome. Not good and not bad but acceptable. Normally when I have seen or had to let someone go I felt bad. But the only thing I felt from snitch was betrayal and pity. He used my trust and abused my good will and it hurt all the same. But it was a different kind of hurt this time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FRIDAY EDIT: Even today, five days after writing this, I feel bad for the guy and honestly hope he gets the help he needs. I just hope I never have to go through this again.

Coming in one morning I hear my phone ding for a new email as I am pulling in off the freeway.  I pull into the parking lot and pull out my phone to see the following email.\n\n\u201cOur department ordered fifty new laptops that just came in this morning.  We need IT to install the latest Windows on them along with the following software (and a long list of software follows).  These computers need to be ready to go by 10 AM tomorrow morning so we can use them for the first class.\u201d\n\nI check to see if this was forwarded by my Boss or his Boss.  Nope, it was sent directly to me.  No ticket, no purchase order information, I didn\u2019t even remember seeing an order for new laptops in any department come through the system in the last month.  So I go to the office and show my Boss who reads the email and tells me that he never had a request for new laptops so he has no idea what it is about.  After a few minutes of trying to call the department with no answer I agree to walk over and see what this was about.\n\nWhen I get to the Department Office I finally track down someone who knows what is going on and she leads me to one of the classrooms with a pile of boxes in the center of the room.  My heart just sinks.\n\nThere before me, a pile of new 7 inch Windows tablets with attaching keyboards sat.  I pick one up and look over the specs.  Low end tablets, barely enough memory to run Windows 10 (installed) but would never run Windows 7 (We haven\u2019t upgraded the school yet, it was still a new OS) and is nowhere near able to run any of the software that they were requesting as each unit had about 16GB of storage.  \n\nNeedless to say, I was a little scared about this.  I asked her how these were even ordered through our system and she tells me that they by-passed the system and ordered from a web company to get a better deal.  I know that there was no reasoning with her so I ask if I could take one down to the office to get a look at it and she agrees with the stern comment of \u201cThese need to be ready by tomorrow!  Make sure it happens!\u201d\n\nBack at the office I show off their new toy to the rest of the staff and my Boss.  None of them are happy, there is no way we can install any software on these let alone connect them to our network so the students can log into them.  My Boss emails the Department Head asking why they didn\u2019t go through IT to get the computers and she responds with the same answer I got earlier, they were cheaper this way.  He lets her know that we couldn\u2019t fulfill the request and that they would be better off returning the computers and that we would work on getting them ones that would work with our network and software.  Well they can\u2019t do that because the website had a no-return policy.  Not only that, but they hadn\u2019t used a purchase order for it, they used the department credit card.  \n\nSo now we are stuck with fifty Windows 10 tablets that the department can\u2019t really do anything with and the Department head is demanding answers as to why no one told her that we couldn\u2019t use those.  For some reason they keep emailing me instead of talking to my Boss so I am getting the front end of the disaster here.  \n\nWe finally get to a work around.  The tablets are set up on the WiFi network and we have to create a generic user account for each tablet along the lines of \u201cDepartmentTab01\u201d and then link that user name to the MAC Address of the tablets so that no one would be able to log into the network with another computer.  They were delivered to the department a week later than they wanted.  \n\nI wish it stopped there, but of course it wouldn\u2019t.  \n\nFirst day with the tablets a trouble ticket comes in saying none of the tablets would connect.  Get to the classroom and the teacher had written one of the user names on the board and was trying to have everyone connect to the WiFi with that one user name.  What is bad is that we had a printed set of login instructions hanging right by the board that she used.  \n\nThen they wouldn\u2019t charge.  Turns out the the tiny barrel plug that these things used had to pushed in all the way to get a connection.  Even just a little short of the mark and they wouldn\u2019t charge.  None of the tablets had been plugged in properly over the course of about two weeks.  \n\n\nAnd we still get random request for software to be installed on these.  The students won\u2019t even use them because the keyboards are just too small to type on unless they have the hands of a seven year old.  \n\nWhy do departments do this to us?

We were doing some cutting edge IT stuff, in getting transcriptions printed at the hospitals remotely, using print queues with the modem number hardcoded in and the system would look for queues with anything in them and dial the number if it found something in that queue.  It worked really well, until it didn't.  \n\nI was the only SysAdmin in this city, so I was on call 24/7/365 and was averaging 3 hours of sleep per night, when I could go home and trying to catch little catnaps here and there when I could.  Anytime something would go wrong on the hospital side I would have to go to the hospital and fix it.  A few months after I started the two of the VP's from Corp relocated to my city, since we were the most productive city with the highest profits.  The first thing they did was come up with an excuse to fire the current director, then they took over operations themselves.  \n\nThen my job went from taking care of our systems to taking care of the doctor's computers too.  I did what I could, but I was also sending out resumes.  Then I was told to go to a hospital and see why the printing stopped.  I remember this day, I hadn't been home for two days and had been going nonstop for 18 hours.  I get there, someone had unplugged the modem.  I plug it back in, call comes in and jobs start printing.  This doctor walks over and tells me that VP#1 told him that I would go out to his house and work on his home computer.  I politely explain to the doctor that I can't do that, and that I'm heading home to get some sleep.  Then I head back to the office to pickup a few things before heading home.    \n\n\nAs soon as I walk through the door I get escorted straight to the VP's Office, both VP#1, VP#2 and the Office Manager are there.  They proceed to start chewing me out.  I just started laughing at them.  I'm the only person in a 1000 miles that knows anything about this system.  They lose their temper and tell me I'm fired and am to leave immediately.  I really said \"Thank You.\"  Then left.\n\nThis was December 15th, my oldest son's birthday.  On the way home I stop a Mom &amp; Pop computer store where I know some of the people to drop off a resume.  They tell me that they have no openings right now but will call me when they do.  I talk to a couple friends while I'm there then head on home.  The only thing I'm worried about is telling my gf that I got fired.  I walk through the door, she's at work.  I see the answering machine blinking so I hit play.  Mom &amp; Pop Computer Store, our primary Novell Engineer just quit are you still available.  I call them back and let them know I'll be there tomorrow.    \n\n\nThat began a much more peaceful career, with better pay, rotating on-call and most every weekend and holiday off.    \n\n\nBTW, The medical transcription firm imploded.

We were doing some cutting edge IT stuff, in getting transcriptions printed at the hospitals remotely, using print queues with the modem number hardcoded in and the system would look for queues with anything in them and dial the number if it found something in that queue.  It worked really well, until it didn&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was the only SysAdmin in this city, so I was on call 24/7/365 and was averaging 3 hours of sleep per night, when I could go home and trying to catch little catnaps here and there when I could.  Anytime something would go wrong on the hospital side I would have to go to the hospital and fix it.  A few months after I started the two of the VP&amp;#39;s from Corp relocated to my city, since we were the most productive city with the highest profits.  The first thing they did was come up with an excuse to fire the current director, then they took over operations themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then my job went from taking care of our systems to taking care of the doctor&amp;#39;s computers too.

boss man  \n$FBI: FBI agent\n\n\nSome years ago, I get an offer for a side job. I nearly always have something going on the side, but it happened that I didn't right then. The guy who made the offer was a friend of an acquaintance. I didn't know anything about him and he lived about 4 hours from me. \n\nWe spend some time talking online, and it seems like a good gig. Basically, it was writing some shipping/warehouse software. He wanted me to travel down to meet him, expenses paid. I agreed. \n\nWhen I got there, things seemed a little bit sketchy, but often people who are starting small businesses or running one-person businesses don't have much capital. So I didn't think too much about it. \n\nWe met in a restaurant. He told me about the job...again. I patiently listen to nothing new, wondering why I had to travel for this. Then he tells me I need to come meet his client. That his client won't sign the contract until we meet. Okay, fair enough. I think his client want's to see if I'm capable. \n\nWe go to the client's place of business. Right before we go in, this guy tells me not to worry about anything he might say. If I have any questions, ask him afterwards. \n\nSo, he represents me to the client as an employee. Other than that, things are fine. I don't get to see any of the computer equipment (the sysadmin isn't there). I don't get to see any of the existing software (because we aren't building off the existing software). \n\nAfter we leave, I question the \"employee\" bit, and the guy says he doesn't want his client to know he's using contract labor. Well...okay. If you're just starting in business, you want to look bigger than you are. \n\nWe get down to brass tacks, and the guy has a whole elaborate system set up for work production and payment. I think it's overly elaborate, but whatever. I'm not planning to cheat the guy, and if he's paranoid, that's his problem. \n\nHe would front me some money, about a week's worth. Every day, I would upload the current source code to the cloud. He wanted to pay by the hour, so I would keep a time sheet of hours worked. \n\n(Personally, I think this is plain stupid. If I give a price for completed work, then I carry the extra time for mistakes. If he pays by the hour, then he carries the price for mistakes. But some people pay for work. Some people pay for the time your ass is in the chair.) \n\nEvery two weeks, he would pay based on the time sheet hours. \n\nThis works out fairly well until the first time he missed a paycheck. I notify him that I haven't received payment and I keep working. When I hit the one week mark (the amount of the initial advance), I keep working but I stop uploading the source code. \n\nI get a paycheck. \n\nI start uploading the source code again. \n\nNext time I send him a time sheet, I get a phone call. \n\n&gt;$BM: You're cheating me! I can see it on your time sheet. There are three days here where you put down hours you didn't work.   \n&gt;$Me: What do you mean?   \n&gt;$BM: You didn't work these three days because I didn't send your paycheck. That's how you forced me to pay you when I didn't have the money.   \n&gt;$Me: I worked those hours. I just didn't upload the source.   \n&gt;$BM: From now on, you need to upload the source or I won't count those hours as work. But I'll go ahead and pay you this time, even though I don't believe you really worked those hours. \n\nMy paycheck finally arrived a few days late, but without the days I supposedly \"didn't work\". \n\nI calculated where I was on hours worked vs. hours paid, taking into account the initial front money. It was good, so I kept working. When I reached the end of the paid hours, I stopped working, and stopped uploading. \n\nI get another phone call:\n\n&gt;$BM: Why are you not uploading source?  \n&gt;$Me: I've run out of money. You didn't send a complete paycheck last time. If you want me to keep working, you need to pay me.   \n&gt;$BM: You're cheating me! Do you think I'm made of money?  \n&gt;$Me: This is what we agreed. If you'd rather switch to a pay for work delivered, I can do that.   \n&gt;$BM: No! You'll cheat me out of more money. I can get some kid out of high school to do this for less than I'm paying you. If you don't start working again, you will lose the whole project.  \n&gt;$Me: Why don't you go find that high school kid? \n\nThat was the end of that. Or so I thought.\n\nAbout a month later, I get a frantic phone call.\n\n&gt;$BM: You have to fix this!  \n&gt;$Me: Fix what?  \n&gt;$BM: The client's computer system has been ~~hac~~compromised. Everything's gone!  \n&gt;$Me: Don't you have another employee now? The one that took my place?  \n&gt;$BM: But he's just a kid. He can't fix this!! Can't you at least give me some suggestions?  \n&gt;$Me: What exactly happened?  \n&gt;$BM: It's the sysadmin. He got fired. He took down the whole system.  \n&gt;$Me: Why did he get fired?  \n&gt;$BM: We didn't need him anymore. The system was up and running fine. After he left, he remoted in and erased all the operating systems.  \n&gt;$Me: Well, you've got backups. Reload everything.   \n&gt;$BM: We can't. The sysadmin got the job because he had unlicensed copies of all the operating systems we needed. He used those to set up the network. Now we can't reload without buying licenses.   \n&gt;$Me: ....\n\nAfter I hung up, I had a good laugh, and realized that I'd dodged a bullet with that company. That was the end of that. Or so I thought. \n\nEarly one Saturday morning, I'm sleeping in. Enjoying a well-earned day off. Phone rings. \n\n&gt;$Me: Hello?  \n&gt;$FBI: This is Special Agent xxxx from the FBI. I need to ask you a few questions about this company.   \n&gt;$Me: I don't work for them anymore.   \n&gt;$FBI: It concerns the computers that were ~~ha~~compromised.   \n&gt;$Me: I wasn't employed there when that happened.  \n&gt;$FBI: Yes, but $BM got some advice from you at the time? He says you can confirm the incident.      \n&gt;$Me: He did call me. I talked to him for about 10 minutes.  \n&gt;$FBI: Good. I need to verify exactly what he told you about the damage done.  \n&gt;$Me: He told me the operating systems had been erased.   \n&gt;$FBI: Yes. Can you estimate how much monetary damage was done by erasing the operating systems?  \n&gt;$Me: Well, none. They didn't own the operating systems, so it's not like any property was damaged or stolen.  \n&gt;$FBI: They didn't own the operating systems?  \n&gt;$Me: That's what they told me. They were running unlicensed copies.   \n&gt;$FBI: He told you that??  \n&gt;$Me: Yes. He told me that the sysadmin, the person who ~~ha~~compromised the system, brought the operating systems with him. After they fired him, he took the operating systems back. But he said they were unlicensed, so I don't know that they legally belonged to the sysadmin.   \n&gt;$FBI: Thank you for your cooperation.   \n", "author_fullname": "t2_12ti8g", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "When you're expected to lie to the FBI", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/talesfromtechsupport", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "all long", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_5w8lci", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6507, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Long r/ALL", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6507, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1488085529.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.talesfromtechsupport", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players in this drama:&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: me&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: boss man&lt;br/&gt;\n$FBI: FBI agent&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I get an offer for a side job. I nearly always have something going on the side, but it happened that I didn&amp;#39;t right then. The guy who made the offer was a friend of an acquaintance. I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about him and he lived about 4 hours from me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spend some time talking online, and it seems like a good gig. Basically, it was writing some shipping/warehouse software. He wanted me to travel down to meet him, expenses paid. I agreed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got there, things seemed a little bit sketchy, but often people who are starting small businesses or running one-person businesses don&amp;#39;t have much capital. So I didn&amp;#39;t think too much about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We met in a restaurant. He told me about the job...again. I patiently listen to nothing new, wondering why I had to travel for this. Then he tells me I need to come meet his client. That his client won&amp;#39;t sign the contract until we meet. Okay, fair enough. I think his client want&amp;#39;s to see if I&amp;#39;m capable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We go to the client&amp;#39;s place of business. Right before we go in, this guy tells me not to worry about anything he might say. If I have any questions, ask him afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, he represents me to the client as an employee. Other than that, things are fine. I don&amp;#39;t get to see any of the computer equipment (the sysadmin isn&amp;#39;t there). I don&amp;#39;t get to see any of the existing software (because we aren&amp;#39;t building off the existing software). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After we leave, I question the &amp;quot;employee&amp;quot; bit, and the guy says he doesn&amp;#39;t want his client to know he&amp;#39;s using contract labor. Well...okay. If you&amp;#39;re just starting in business, you want to look bigger than you are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get down to brass tacks, and the guy has a whole elaborate system set up for work production and payment. I think it&amp;#39;s overly elaborate, but whatever. I&amp;#39;m not planning to cheat the guy, and if he&amp;#39;s paranoid, that&amp;#39;s his problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He would front me some money, about a week&amp;#39;s worth. Every day, I would upload the current source code to the cloud. He wanted to pay by the hour, so I would keep a time sheet of hours worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Personally, I think this is plain stupid. If I give a price for completed work, then I carry the extra time for mistakes. If he pays by the hour, then he carries the price for mistakes. But some people pay for work. Some people pay for the time your ass is in the chair.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every two weeks, he would pay based on the time sheet hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This works out fairly well until the first time he missed a paycheck. I notify him that I haven&amp;#39;t received payment and I keep working. When I hit the one week mark (the amount of the initial advance), I keep working but I stop uploading the source code. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get a paycheck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I start uploading the source code again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time I send him a time sheet, I get a phone call. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$BM: You&amp;#39;re cheating me! I can see it on your time sheet. There are three days here where you put down hours you didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: What do you mean?&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: You didn&amp;#39;t work these three days because I didn&amp;#39;t send your paycheck. That&amp;#39;s how you forced me to pay you when I didn&amp;#39;t have the money.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: I worked those hours. I just didn&amp;#39;t upload the source.&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: From now on, you need to upload the source or I won&amp;#39;t count those hours as work. But I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and pay you this time, even though I don&amp;#39;t believe you really worked those hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My paycheck finally arrived a few days late, but without the days I supposedly &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I calculated where I was on hours worked vs. hours paid, taking into account the initial front money. It was good, so I kept working. When I reached the end of the paid hours, I stopped working, and stopped uploading. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get another phone call:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$BM: Why are you not uploading source?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: I&amp;#39;ve run out of money. You didn&amp;#39;t send a complete paycheck last time. If you want me to keep working, you need to pay me.&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: You&amp;#39;re cheating me! Do you think I&amp;#39;m made of money?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: This is what we agreed. If you&amp;#39;d rather switch to a pay for work delivered, I can do that.&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: No! You&amp;#39;ll cheat me out of more money. I can get some kid out of high school to do this for less than I&amp;#39;m paying you. If you don&amp;#39;t start working again, you will lose the whole project.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Why don&amp;#39;t you go find that high school kid? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the end of that. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a month later, I get a frantic phone call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$BM: You have to fix this!&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Fix what?&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: The client&amp;#39;s computer system has been &lt;del&gt;hac&lt;/del&gt;compromised. Everything&amp;#39;s gone!&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Don&amp;#39;t you have another employee now? The one that took my place?&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: But he&amp;#39;s just a kid. He can&amp;#39;t fix this!! Can&amp;#39;t you at least give me some suggestions?&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: What exactly happened?&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: It&amp;#39;s the sysadmin. He got fired. He took down the whole system.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Why did he get fired?&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: We didn&amp;#39;t need him anymore. The system was up and running fine. After he left, he remoted in and erased all the operating systems.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: Well, you&amp;#39;ve got backups. Reload everything.&lt;br/&gt;\n$BM: We can&amp;#39;t. The sysadmin got the job because he had unlicensed copies of all the operating systems we needed. He used those to set up the network. Now we can&amp;#39;t reload without buying licenses.&lt;br/&gt;\n$Me: ....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I hung up, I had a good laugh, and realized that I&amp;#39;d dodged a bullet with that company.

Plugging VGA cables into desk stations to fix \"broken computers\" is not a story, it's business as usual.\n\nA few companies later, when the buzzwords \"business intelligence\", \"data analysis\", \"data driven decisions\", etc. started to pop up on the corporate bullshit bingo I was already involved in these things at my current workplace.

I'm as lazy as it comes, if I have to do the same task twice I'm going to spend an unreasonable time (trying) to automate it.\n\nThe result of my laziness was a PowerBI dashboard hosted on SharePoint.

It was also a horrible mess, but I tried to keep it as organized as possible. Code on GitHub in a private repo, regular and conventional commits, issue tracking, (well?) written documentation for everything, all the other best practices. My team's standard reporting tasks, which were taking usually an entire week at the end of each month condensed down to a few hours, which in theory could've been less if I had trusted myself, but I always QA-d the final result before releasing it for use.\n\nSo, in addition to my standard role (which I performed \"above expectations\" according to my annual reviews) I was the local BI developer/data analyst/ad-hoc tech support. At every salary increase cycle I always had to ask for a salary at the top of the range of the role which I had on paper, citing the above reasons. The company always fought tooth and nail and it was always a painful and a bit humiliating experience. (Un)Fortunately after a few years they've decided that \"Now that you've built these solutions, we don't need you anymore, we only need to hire someone to maintain it. You are fired.\" According to my contract this would mean I'm still employed for another 60 days. I made sure to double-check everything, rewrite some of the documentation to be more clear, refactor the code, especially my early kludgy solutions, made backups on my team's OneDrive, fixed as many issues I could, etc. In short,  I tried to make sure that everything goes smoothly when my replacement takes over. By the time my notice period was up they still couldn't find anyone as they've been advertising a wonderful \"3 in 1\" package. Yep, my successor was supposed to do everything I was doing...\n\nMy last day was at the end of the month and I pushed out one more update under the watchful eye of my supervisor. As soon as they saw that everything has updated security came in and my boss said to delete everything from GitHub as it's an external site and a security risk. I tried to explain that it's tied to my corporate email and it would be best to keep it alive and transfer ownership to my successor, they wouldn't budge and told me to delete it. Okay then, let's nuke it from orbit. Told them that there's a local copy (duh) on my work laptop and also on OneDrive (not in my private folder) they said IT will take care of it. Apparently that meant a deep cleanse of my laptop without retaining any of the data (while the \"she's on maternity leave\" woman's laptop was still in locker after 4 years...), so the only remaining copy was in my former team's shared OneDrive folder.\n\nA month passed and my former boss called me asking for help. They still haven't found a replacement unsurprisingly. Not wanting to burn any bridges and because I'm a exploitable idiot I told them sure, I'll help, toss in a steak dinner voucher for two at a local mid-range restaurant and I'll help. They were dragging their feet, despite the fact that my ask was significantly lower in value than what the contractor rate would've been and I knew they could expense it anyway. After a day or two they gave in, I hopped on my bike, signed an NDA, got a laptop and asked a team member to add me to the Teams channel so I can start working (long live python -m pip install -r requirements.txt, or so I've thought).\n\nAs I started to poke around on OneDrive I couldn't find my backup folder. After a while went to ask my former boss where did they move it, as I can't find it anywhere.\n\n\"Oh, we deleted them, didn't seem important. Were only a couple of files though, I'm sure you can easily do it again\".\n\nThose \"few files\" where the result of hundreds of hours of experimentation, trying to figure out how the various systems work together, just the pandas part was a couple hundred lines of unfucking data, and without documentation there was literally zero chance of recreating it in a short amount of time.\n\n\"Can't you just restore from that online hub thing?\" - Not really, as you specifically asked me to delete it despite my protests...\n\nI left without getting my steak dinner. A few days later they've called me again asking me how much would it cost make a brand new dashboard. Apparently some corporate bigwigs overseas were using it for their C-level bullshit PowerPoint meetings (remember, it included global data) and were pretty pissed that the fancy charts are gone.\n\nI may or may not have found a relatively recent local version of the git repo on my raspberry, which I may or may not have used to do some of the number crunching as my old shitty corporate laptop could barely handle anything (yep a RPi4 8GB outperformed it). May or may not have forgotten to mention this obvious security breach and billed out my hours as I've been creating everything from scratch.\n\nTLDR: \"You are no longer needed\" makes shiny charts go away, which could've been fixed with a steak dinner if people weren't stupid. They were and I could buy a few nice things.

Yep, my successor was supposed to do everything I was doing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last day was at the end of the month and I pushed out one more update under the watchful eye of my supervisor. As soon as they saw that everything has updated security came in and my boss said to delete everything from GitHub as it&amp;#39;s an external site and a security risk. I tried to explain that it&amp;#39;s tied to my corporate email and it would be best to keep it alive and transfer ownership to my successor, they wouldn&amp;#39;t budge and told me to delete it. Okay then, let&amp;#39;s nuke it from orbit. Told them that there&amp;#39;s a local copy (duh) on my work laptop and also on OneDrive (not in my private folder) they said IT will take care of it. Apparently that meant a deep cleanse of my laptop without retaining any of the data (while the &amp;quot;she&amp;#39;s on maternity leave&amp;quot; woman&amp;#39;s laptop was still in locker after 4 years...), so the only remaining copy was in my former team&amp;#39;s shared OneDrive folder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month passed and my former boss called me asking for help. They still haven&amp;#39;t found a replacement unsurprisingly. Not wanting to burn any bridges and because I&amp;#39;m a exploitable idiot I told them sure, I&amp;#39;ll help, toss in a steak dinner voucher for two at a local mid-range restaurant and I&amp;#39;ll help. They were dragging their feet, despite the fact that my ask was significantly lower in value than what the contractor rate would&amp;#39;ve been and I knew they could expense it anyway. After a day or two they gave in, I hopped on my bike, signed an NDA, got a laptop and asked a team member to add me to the Teams channel so I can start working (long live python -m pip install -r requirements.txt, or so I&amp;#39;ve thought).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I started to poke around on OneDrive I couldn&amp;#39;t find my backup folder. After a while went to ask my former boss where did they move it, as I can&amp;#39;t find it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, we deleted them, didn&amp;#39;t seem important. Were only a couple of files though, I&amp;#39;m sure you can easily do it again&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those &amp;quot;few files&amp;quot; where the result of hundreds of hours of experimentation, trying to figure out how the various systems work together, just the pandas part was a couple hundred lines of unfucking data, and without documentation there was literally zero chance of recreating it in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t you just restore from that online hub thing?&amp;quot; - Not really, as you specifically asked me to delete it despite my protests...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left without getting my steak dinner. A few days later they&amp;#39;ve called me again asking me how much would it cost make a brand new dashboard. Apparently some corporate bigwigs overseas were using it for their C-level bullshit PowerPoint meetings (remember, it included global data) and were pretty pissed that the fancy charts are gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I may or may not have found a relatively recent local version of the git repo on my raspberry, which I may or may not have used to do some of the number crunching as my old shitty corporate laptop could barely handle anything (yep a RPi4 8GB outperformed it). May or may not have forgotten to mention this obvious security breach and billed out my hours as I&amp;#39;ve been creating everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: &amp;quot;You are no longer needed&amp;quot; makes shiny charts go away, which could&amp;#39;ve been fixed with a steak dinner if people weren&amp;#39;t stupid. They were and I could buy a few nice things. I have expensive hobbies :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c670b7d7bc99c03bffde92706ad5ceeda12658f3", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63a498673bd4a518a031783179a767cc4135d5f5", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e8802df47965bd66370b72ac3cb7639e9eae92ae", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc40ae1c1a18193f190da70a2748d0a48c17a5a9", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77ba4d8e862ca183dd8c09e002fd123a6b2f52f5", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.

Not to be that person, but I'm really freaking out here and I have no time left until my presentation....\n\nMe:  Ok, well what's your laptop showing? \n\nDM:  It's not powering on.  It showed like a blue screen and just turned off on its own and now won't turn on.... \n\nMe:  Yeah.  That doesn't sound good.  We might have to replace your laptop....\n\nDM:  Oh my god....

Let me see what I can do.  \n\nDM: (continues crying)\n\nMe:  Alright.  So when you worked on your presentation it was a powerpoint right?\n\nDM:  Yes... (sniff)\n\nMe:  Did you have it saved on a network drive or just on your computer?  \n\nDM:  i'm not sure.  I think just on my computer... (sniff)\n\nMe:  Ok, I'm willing to bet you saved it on the network drive and didn't know it. \n\nDM:  Ok.  \n\nMe:  I have to search like a million folders.  Can you tell me the name of presentation?\n\nDM:  Yeah.  It's  ********************\n\nMe:  Ok.  Let's see.  2016 right?\n\nDM:  Yeah  (sniff)\n\nMe:  Got it!  \n\nDM:  Shut up.....

I don't know the connection of the conference room but there should be a way to airplay your powerpoint from your ipad to the tv or whatever they have.
